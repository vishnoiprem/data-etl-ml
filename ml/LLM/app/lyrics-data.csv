Ed Sheeran,Shape Of You,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you"
Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in
and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were
The someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids
When we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling
You look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger
Than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry
More than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry
children of our own
We are still kids
But we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling
You look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

Darlin' I will be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
Baby my heart could still fall as hard
At twenty three

I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mm)
I know you will still love me the same

Cause honey your soul
Could never grow old
It's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That baby now (ooh)
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

Baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars (oh darlin')
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud

Maybe we found love right where we are
Maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
Ed Sheeran,Bad Habits,"(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight I had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you"
Ed Sheeran,Shivers,"I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
Fill up the engines, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all, mm
Ooh, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night, mm
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me thе shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And whеn they say the party's over then we bring it right back
And we say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back

Into the car, on the back seat in the moon lit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Ooh, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night

And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back

Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing is started
I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver, oh, oh
Baby, you are so hot you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing is started
I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver

Ed Sheeran,The Joker and the Queen,"How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen"
Ed Sheeran,I Don't Care (With Justin Bieber),"I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Can you take my hand?
Finish my drink, say, ""shall we dance? "" (hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah

And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'cause I don't care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere

When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Press your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where we're s'posed to be
You know what?
It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
And you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
But now I think that we should stay

Ed Sheeran,Perfect Duet (With Beyoncé),"I found a love for me
Oh, darling just dive right in and follow my lead
Well I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the
someone waiting for me

Cause we were just kids when
we fell in love
Not knowing what it was,
I will not give you up this time
Darling just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while
listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess,
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
darling you look perfect tonight

Well I found a man, stronger
than anyone I know
He shares my dreams,
I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more
than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry
children of our own

We are still kids,
but we're so in love,
fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand,
be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well baby I'm dancing in the dark,

When I saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this,
darling you look perfect tonight

Ed Sheeran,I Love You,"I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home

But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you"
Ed Sheeran,Tides,"I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that you will do

Freight cargo, dot stops and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low, serotonin known better days
Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me

Timе stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, lifе is changin' tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
To busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I have no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides"
Ed Sheeran,Happier,"Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle
And telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"
Ed Sheeran,Overpass Graffiti,"This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold, alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us, or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow, alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me

Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Oh, graffiti on the overpass"
Ed Sheeran,Don't,"I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait

But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets until the late Am
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day

Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Ah-la-la-la-la
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"
Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb higher into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning)
(Fire)
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) (fire)
And I see fire (fire)
And I see fire (burn on and on the mountainside)"
Ed Sheeran,First Times,"I thought it'd feel different, playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn, I
Still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
(MM, mm)

The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, ""Darling, are you jokin'? "", and I just said, ""Please""

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said ""I love you"", I
Can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
(MM, mm)

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden, I
Can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times"
Ed Sheeran,Beautiful People (feat. Khalid),"We are, we are, we are

LA on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on
So they're headin' downtown
('Round here) everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we've become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
What d'you do and who d'you know
Inside the world of beautiful people?
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (beautiful)

LA, mm
Drove for hours last night
And we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes
When we're halfway there (all night)
I'm not fazed
By all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you
There's no need to care

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here

Ed Sheeran,Kiss Me,"Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in

Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed in my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed in my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love from love to lust
From lust to truth I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love"
Ed Sheeran,Love Yourself (Kiss Fm session cover),"For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart
oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I been movin' on
and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I been movin' on
and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
Ed Sheeran,Visiting Hours,"I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
So I could just show up
And bring the news
That she's getting older
And I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me
I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

Well, I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
So I could just swing by
And ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do?
'Cause you always do what's right

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's
In the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that heaven
Had visiting hours
And I would ask them
If I could take you home
But I know what they'd say
That it's for the best
So I would live life the way you told me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away"
Ed Sheeran,Castle On The Hill,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume
Of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields
And getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
Ed Sheeran,Dive,"Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
There's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you"
Ed Sheeran,...Baby One More Time,"Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go"
Ed Sheeran,1000 Nights (feat. a Boogie wit da Hoodie & Meek Mill),"Oh, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on, putting up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista!
Do it all again when we touchdown
Everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, ""What now? ""
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we popping
We bubble like soda pop
And I see it, I like it, I wake up
Pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired
Them bunny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold the rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadium, tell 'em, ""Play my shit""
And they gon' sing like this

Oh, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on, putting up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big
But what does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Sprinter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't here, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option
To get a cheaper lunch
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

Oh, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on, putting up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights

MM, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on a regular, make it seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her in Celine, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She wish she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road so long
She couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

Oh, I been up for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day
Playin' on, playin' on, putting up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on
Stayin' up for a thousand nights"
Ed Sheeran,2step,"I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess
That just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lucid conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin' up
And when I'm on your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low
Then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come
When I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I've got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less
Then she needs, so we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turnin' up
And when I'm on your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low
Then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love

All we need is us to go all night"
Ed Sheeran,Addicted,"I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again

And now i'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

Oh well we've come this far
Your my Venus and I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone

And now i'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

And now i'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
So please come home"
Ed Sheeran,Afire Love,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you are lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped In light and life and love

Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight, we're afire love

Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
Now we're left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
6 years old I remember when

My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped In light and life and love

Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight, we're afire love

My father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
My father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing
Hallelujah"
Ed Sheeran,Afterglow,"Stop the clocks it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow"
Ed Sheeran,All My Life (Nizlopi Cover),"Darling, I've been waiting for you
All my life
Crossed towns and hills and river for you
All my life
But I'm wondering in the dark now, 'cause we need to make it through
So please walk beside me in all I do

I'm really cant pull out the thorn, love
All my life
And not having you pressed to my chest
All my life
This storm is playing out now, and we need to make it through
Of all our incompleteness in the wars we do
So won't you come here?

'Cause it's written on my hand
I wanna print it on your body yeah, print it on your soul
Singing, your love makes me a different man
I want its soul into my body, I want its soul into me

Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian from your heart
Evian from your pants, darlin'
Evian from your lips, darlin'
Evian from your hands
I wanna drink evian, evian

And I'm singing songs of love like getting jolly all my life
And we'll find the truth out, finally
In the heart of our lifes
Now this song is playing out now, and we need to make it through

Ed Sheeran,All Of The Stars,"It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
Saw a shooting star and thought of you

Sang a lullaby by the water side and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you

You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away froom seeing you

I can see the stars from America
I wonder, do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know these skies will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us

Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand
Back through lands and streets I knew
Everything led back to you

So, can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is beating to?

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of the stars will guide us home

I can see the stars from America"
Ed Sheeran,Antisocial (With Travis Scott),"All you cool people better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen

Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (Yeah)
When I touchdown, keep it on the low-low (It's lit!)
I don't mess with your energy (Nah) , no photos (Ayy)
So antisocial, but I don't care (Ayy)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (Ayy, pop it)
Got a bottle in my hand
Bring more though (Ayy, pop it, pop it)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up!)

I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something

(I need room, I need room
I need room, I need room)
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes (Yah) , might catch fumes
When I zoom (Pew) , when I zoom
Pass out, wake up on by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Hit the ground and I'm movin' on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (Drown)
Right before I leave
She give me more than just a ""miss you"" (Yeah)
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can't hit it
(In the back) Seen the vision in the boy
Then we commit it (It's lit!)

I've been lost out in outer space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name

Ed Sheeran,Autumn Leaves,"Another day another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated

Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated

Another love that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh

Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Or stay out and we'll live forever now"
Ed Sheeran,Bad Habits (Feat. Tion Wayne & Central Cee) (Fumez The Engineer Remix),"Ooh
(You know a lot of people ask us
""How is C-Dot funded?
And where do you get your money from? ""
The simple answer)

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
(Grr, mm-mm, yeah)

Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Girl up on my left side, girl up on my right (Mm-mm)
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Bow, bow, bow)
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Beforе the music, had to put a shift in
Made Lambo money from a Citröеn (Boom)
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in the system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my veins)
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom)
Bad habits, can't end up with case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi, go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy)
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad)
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're having flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck (Ooh) , he got brucked up (Ooh)
In my drop-top (Ooh) , getting top-top (Boom)
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
'Nother boy eating, bidda-bop-bop (Boom)
But fuck what you're telling them, I'm from Edmonton
Bad vibes everything
Rolex or I might bust my skeleton (Buh, buh, buh)
(My bad habits lead to you)

I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say something I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap on
Messed up with my good girl, on a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin' out, takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ay, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body in tight, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up

I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr)
Bad sight weh me keep up the fuckery (Bow)
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm)
Bad time, but today I'm lucky
Yo, in the rear with the gauge (Bow)
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom)
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Mm, mm)
She left me on read back then when I had no bread
Like shorty didn't trust the process
Free all the guys locked down four walls
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it
But you gotta do what you gotta do
And you're stuck in the hood just hopin'
I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left is an artist
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the rhaatid
Think I won't pull up and bark it
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic
Yay come white like yam, it ain't powdered
Looking for cribs, just fully detached
I came from council housing
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask for a chance
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password
When it's really on, when's he gonna clart it off?
No fears cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is
Always aim at the target market
Look at the profit margin

I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold

Fumez The Engineer
If bro calls me and say it's time, I don't care
I'm putting my ca-, I'm putting my career on hold
But why everyone, but why everyone
But why everyone there when you blow?"
Ed Sheeran,Bad Habits (Meduza Remix),"Yeah

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

We, we, we, we, we

We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Every purе intention ends when thе good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

We, we, we, we, we"
Ed Sheeran,Be Like You,"Unhappy days that left us on the floor
And you'd breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure

Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton I'll take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened I'll make it disappear

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you

And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

Sunny days that left my skin blood red
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated

Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This loves too overrated
See what's going on, on

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose now

When I'm missing you I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze in to a dress so I can be like you

And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home, take me back to Albert Road
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too

I thought I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I've stopped eating food
And I've squeezed in to your dress so I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too"

Ed Sheeran,Be Right Now,"A lifetime startin' to feel like
It's fallin' short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Just stay here and be right now

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now"
Ed Sheeran,Best Part Of Me (feat. YEBBA),"My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too

Oh baby, I'm so in love with you"
Ed Sheeran,Beyond the Pale,"Just lay it all down on me
it's getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me

And you know I've learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
can't keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what's there beyond the pale

I feel like I've gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?

You know I've learned from my mistakes
How much have I got to lose?
You find my heart hard to break
can't keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what's there beyond the pale

What can I do
Just to let you know
That you're in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time"
Ed Sheeran,Billy Ruskin,"Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
we're losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who's your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can't seem to even let you breathe

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

Come and show me if you can
See I know you're me
But I can't seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
it's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me"

Ed Sheeran,Bonus Track,"I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over

I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

Don't want your advice
Cos I've made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I've heard it before
So don't try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It's no surprise
That you'd wanna waste your time

I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need"
Ed Sheeran,Candle In The Wind,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did"
Ed Sheeran,Castle On The Hill (Radiology Remix),"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume
Of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields
And getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home"
Ed Sheeran,Chasing Cars (Snow Patrol live cover with Gary Lightbody),"We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
will never change for us at all

So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world"
Ed Sheeran,Cold Coffee,"She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke

And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep

Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now

Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?

Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know, tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to

Tell me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Collide,"Oh yeah, we've been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home
We've seen the moon reflect on the rollin' tide
Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise
Becausе the world looks better whеn I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

We've been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes
MM, we drank your father's whiskey
When your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

Head first, collidin'
Dreamers collidin'
Universe collidin'
Your love let the light in
Head first, collidin'
Dreamers collidin'
Universe collidin'

We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring, but I didn't mind
‘Cause I got a feeling, baby, we'll be fine"
Ed Sheeran,Cross Me (Ft. Chance The Rapper & PnB Rock),"Anything she needs, she can call me

Boom! Kung Pow! Hit your ass with a cross kick
Pullin' air out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a little blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit
Ay, no one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the H. B. I. C
Couple of things that you need to know

Ed Sheeran,Diary,"Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon its been doing weights
Eating raw eggs and cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love as I'm driving vans
I try to steer intoxicated with another love inside lands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take care tonight

If you could only say the words
I'll take it and I'll write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Untill the day you found me out
But I know your love
And thats why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

And your love
Has never my enemy
Used to hold me
And pormise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your lo-o-ve
Told me it was fell into a different page
And you know if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe

If you could only say the words
I'll take it and I'll write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Untill the day you found me out
But I know your love
And thats why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words

You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Coz work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognising my love for kiera knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I dont have
to watch love actually again but you're actually the same
Its just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Untill the dishes finish
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
Its better to do
Yep love is ahead of the truth
That in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devin you

Diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
Yeah"

Gimme some room, comin' through
Paid my dues, in the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room
Dj's spinnin' (show your hands)
Let's get dirty (that's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' till my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action

Temperature's up (can you feel it?)
'Bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', gettin' just a little naughty

Sweatin' till my clothes come off

Get up, get it up, yup that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum

What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh oh, here we go

Yo, hot damn, Doc and Jam like a summer show
I keep my car lookin' like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina, better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waitin' for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up

Baby it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm Odb, the way I'm

Gonna get rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty

Ed Sheeran,Do They Know It's Christmas?,"It's christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At christmas time we let in light and banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At christmas time, it's hard, but while you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where a kiss of love can kill you
And there's death in every tear
And the christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight we're reaching out and touching you

No peace and joy this christmas to west africa
A song of hope and there's no hope tonight, ooh
Why is coming first to be feared?
Why is to touch to be scared?
How can they know it's christmas time at all?

Here's to you
Raise a glass to everyone
Here's to them
And all their years to come
How they know it's christmas time at all?

Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's christmas time again

Heal the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Feed the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Feel the world, let them know it's christmas time again
Heal the world, let them know it's christmas time again"
Ed Sheeran,Don't (Feat. Rick Ross),"Hit the corner, burnin' rubber
Like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said
She's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor

And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)

Thug niggaz drug dealers yeah they givin it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

It's the motherfuckin D. R. E. (snoop doog)
La-da-da-da-dahh
You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G

eyo eyo eyo eyoo

But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the Dvd, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the barb with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
Now"
Ed Sheeran,Drown Me Out (Feat. Ghetts),"I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It seems when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, [?]
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat

OO, you can drag me in the deep ends
OO, but you will never drown me out
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends
OO, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out

You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive

OO, you can drag me in the deep ends
OO, but you will never drown me out
OO, you can drag me in the deep ends
OO, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out"
Ed Sheeran,Drunk,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse that I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all,

Love will scar your makeup
Lip sticks to me, so now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But the house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So shall we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to

There may be other people like us,
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light us,
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
I'm here to applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again,
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
Ed Sheeran,Empire State Of Mind (Cover),"Yeah I'm out that Brooklyn
Now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro
But I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra
And since I made it here
I can make it anywhere
(Yeah they love me everywhere)
I used to cop in Harlem
All of my Dominicanos (Hey yo)
Right there off of Broadway
Brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot
560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like Simmons whipping Pastry
Cruising down 8th street
Off-white Lexus
Driving so slow
(but BK, it's from Texas!)
Me I'm out that BedStuy
Home of that boy Biggie
now I live on Billboard
and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ta-ta
Still sipping Mai Tais
Sitting courtside
Knicks and Nets give me high-5
N**ga, I be Spiked out
I could trip a referee
tell by my attitude that I'm MOST DEFINITELY FROM

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new

Welcome to the bright light

Lights is blinding
girls need blinders
so they can step out of bounds quick
the side lines is blind with casualties
who sip the lite casually
then gradually become worse
don't bite the apple Eve
caught up in the in crowd
now you're in-style
and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
the city of sin is a pity on a whim
good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin
and Jesus can't save you
life starts when the church ends
came here for school, graduated to the high life
ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
the city never sleeps better slip you a Ambien

New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
the lights will inspire you

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
no place in the World that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaahh

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
the lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York"
Ed Sheeran,English Rose,"Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me
I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me

So I'll make my way
Through long, winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad
On the phone, ""It's amazing""
From the straight to the crazy
These places I've seen
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
I spend my days just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I met a man
In a bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
And he told me, ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""
And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

My heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
My heart still beats
For my home and my English rose"
Ed Sheeran,Eraser,"I was born inside a small town
I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon
They kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy
When they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me
Is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me
I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky
With white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point
I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors
I find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things
That can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better
Than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life
I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream
Man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach
Like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed
With the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate
But keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things
That will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high
And my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngling
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school
And missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it
Put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it
Put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency
And the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life
And what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, ""Fuck you""
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays
But yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but
It's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day
Well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it
Put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it
Put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', ""Don't smoke, "" no, I don't listen
I got love for a ghost note
Shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times
And words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick
I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me
""Work hard and you can never be shit""
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish"
Ed Sheeran,Even My Dad Does Sometimes,"It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive

It's alright to die
Cause that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light

It is alright to say
That death's the only thing you haven't
tried
But just for today
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on

Live life like you're giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on"
Ed Sheeran,Everything Has Changed,"All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel right

I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach
Is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight
Making me feel right

I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just want to know you better know
You better know you better now
I just want to know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is we held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound brightness
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed"
Ed Sheeran,Everything You Are,"I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
Won't you just hold me tonight?

I wish I never called you up
But nobody told me
They don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight?

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret, it never works out anyway
But I'm not anything like it was
Cause you were the only one for me

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life, too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
And you did the same
Again and again and again
I know

So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret, it never works out anyway
But I'm not anything like it was
Cause you were the only one for me

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life, too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are

When I see my future, it is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you
We'll get there

Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life, too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth
Lies everything you are"
Ed Sheeran,Faces,"Faces Change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know
When I'll go

Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans, some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam, rock, sing *no wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
Cuz no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six pack
And a shotgun just for show?
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's right
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin jam
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin in
I'm goin home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the Uk
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass

You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, there's a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael
M. W. A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink

You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly"
Ed Sheeran,Fairytale Of New York (With Anne-Marie in the Live Lounge),"It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway
Was waiting for me

""You were handsome! "" ""You were pretty
Queen of New York City""
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
And we kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

And the boys of the Nypd choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

""You're a bum, you're a punk""
""You're an old cut on junk
Lying there almost dead
On a drip in that bed""
""You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy blagger
Merry Christmas, you mugger
I pray God it's our last""

The boys of the Nypd choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

""I could have been someone""
""Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you""
""I took them with me, babe
I kept them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you""

Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day"
Ed Sheeran,Fall,"You and I
Two of a mind
This love is one of a kind
You and I
We're drifting over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
Learning to speak with kisses on cheeks
You and I
We're lifting over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if fall for you
Would you fall too?

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if fall for you
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too"
Ed Sheeran,Fall Down,"In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know

Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
and I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and I'll fall down

Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
and last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no were left to land
and I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and I'll fall down

Tell me that there's no were left to land
and I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and I'll fall down"
Ed Sheeran,Family (feat. P Money),"Hmm let me go,
To see my family.
Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye,
Because only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this rhyme,
It seems like I had too much wine.
Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the ? booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one.
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No motion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain.
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running.
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
the stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first air kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in.
Never done dream for a while,
The black plan was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family.
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul."
Ed Sheeran,Feeling Good,"Birds flying high you know how I feel
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea you know how I feel
River running free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel

Dragonfly out in the sun you know
What I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin'
Fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean

And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the pine you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel"
Ed Sheeran,Feels (Ft. J Hus & Young Thug),"Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah
(Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Drop it to the ground, lean hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no lend
Gotta trust your crowd, got her layin' in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it as loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out
The rap 'til we leave
I was bangin' suicide for the rivers
I done went and bought a car with the title
Tell the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah
(Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real

Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met
I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (MM)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Feels, yeah

I waited most my life for somethin' real

Ed Sheeran,Fire Alarms,"The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor

What I need to know
Is if you love me and I really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms

And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call

We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away

We are waving
(And what I need to know)
We are waving
(Is if you love me and I)

We are waving
(Really need to know)
We are waving
(If you need me when you call)

We are waving
(What I need to know)
We are waving
(Is if you love me and I)

We are waving

We are waving

What I need to know

Ed Sheeran,Firefly,"I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

Teach my skin
Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me
Get to sleep

And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That's not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes"
Ed Sheeran,Follow Fashion,"I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras flashing, champagne splashing, money dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
Follow fashion, (come, come come) follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Ever since xo called on me like eric prydz to tear this shit
To many bits
I've been asking myself will they think of me
as a trendy prick
In a pair of chinos and expensive kicks
Fixed gear bike doing lengthy skids
Peddling around, representing kids
that are doing strictly independent bizz-ness
Is-this
Viewed as a life full of slick pretences
Well you cunts really should look deeper
You should have my prescription lenses
That I wear
Better still, get yourself some of that eyewear
Then stand right there
I bet you'd still, get the impression that I'd care
I know that if I don't really show my emotions
to such fools then I can't get hurt
But there's hardly a need for a heart on my sleeve
this is such a cool benjart sweatshirt
So the only heart you'll see is on my chest
right where the s should be
And your girlfriends also hate my style
that explains why they're undressing me

Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion
Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

I consume any room I'm in
Before anyone hears me rhyming
Too tall so forget climbing
Repeat after me simon (ayoo)
As I walk into the room it (froze)
To see a 6 "" 10 man wearing
Oh my God where diddy diddy diddy (uh)
where did he get them clothes
Hair in two, runaway tache (amazing)
With a rhyming gift that sounds (amazing)
More style than a g g magazine
pitbull holler at me I'm (amazing)
6'10 Presence of big ben, tourists flash your cameras
cos I'm (amazing)
I've been covered in tweed from 1. 5 plus a 10 bag of weed
I've been dressing as fly from simpsons days no family guy
Fly co-d fontzerelli
Check check check me on your tele
Flashing a six pack no belly
While rocking playdot yo kennay

I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras flashing, champagne splashing, money dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion
Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

They said it's impossible for me to rep the Uk
Because of the way that I dress, yes, they say that I'm gay?
But I've been taking all of your chicks since like 03
So whilst you niggas are into beef
Me, I'm collecting poultry
Never smoking, never choking on this new new
I'm the shit so there ain't nothing I can't do do
Looking in my face saying I can't rap star
Now you're into skinny jeans, snapbacks and trapstarr
I'm a star that traps, in a solar system
Record labels are pissed because they fucking missed em
Chicks think I'm hot, niggas say I'm cool
Regardless it's going down, Berlin wall
And I don't really care, comfortable
Got so much drive, I'll never stall

I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras flashing, champagne splashing, money dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

I don't follow fashion I set trends
You know sin la co star no sing
My creps are bosy dior or this or dior that
Super brand sin I am fresh like that
Don gar con in com de gar son
Collete store Paris where you get that
from I do it first then they follow my lead
@ sincereartist follow my tweets
Thank God that my lil bro didn't follow me to
To the trap with the cats and the dogs
See the dogs are the straps
and the cats are the fiends kept loads on my line
and 1 in my jeans
That was like 01 now its 2011 I style
I stunt I get what I want
Baguettes are so nuts wrist is all gold
Bricks is all sold kicks louboutons
Predict a new storm coz I am about to rain
for the next decade so come follow me come
come swallow me little pyt
Clc or maybe tt coz I change wip
like I change those creps
now let's get back to my to my rainbow neck
that's about 10 bags on my diamond set

I'm from a place people stop and stare
Carry small dogs and make what they wear
Cameras flashing, champagne splashing, money dashing
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion

Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion
Follow fashion, follow follow fashion
This is the life we lead so come and follow fashion"
Ed Sheeran,Friends,"We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do

And that's why friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you

No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like you"

Ed Sheeran,Galway Girl,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street
Right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me
While her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean
The Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs
Do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with
Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts
And then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me
Like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called
Was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice
Playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room
Swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome
And it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs
With the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

That your lips allow

My my, my, my oh give me love

Give me love like it meant life or death
like it meant your final breathe, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time
so it don? t matter if you? re poor or not
Give me that real love
Something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya
Just like the first time you said it
Give me love
Because hate is the worst kind of weapon
It?Is like I finally see the person in my reflection"

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups, didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what?
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything other than that

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved

I never told her that I liked
They way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words
To a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups, didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what?
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything other than that

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved
Hey

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown ups, didn't learn a thing
But then again you know what?
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything other than that

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You want to be loved"
Ed Sheeran,Goodbye To You (feat. Dot Rotten),"Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know hmm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
how could I say goodbye to you
when I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life
that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food,
for the whole fam
you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man,
cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of
hatred in your own plant ,
3 jobs in a day ,
rest in life in you working but you were never stressed free
just locked in a cage slaving , they said they were
gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to
amazement , broke your heart but still you were prone
to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right ,
I still think of you every Sunday no
one can top your chicken and rice,
even through the darkness times
you held us all up cause your vision was
bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside ,
you never let anyone see your heartache
you just got on with it ,
anyone tells me that they knew you said
you were beautiful and your words you would stand
strong with it. Cause they were like warmth on a winter
night but I was just too young to go on with it and
there something's I could try to do but it's an
impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to
you , I couldn't do that , I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time
you know I never want to be alone ohh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you?
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace.
Can I say goodbye to you ohh

I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of
things that I know now I would be by your side when you
needed me instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out'
standing in a road with the gangs that I know now ,
everyone's missing you loads , Jessica's grown up ,
warren Lauren and Alex are fine and imp living with
hope , it's been a while since I've seen V and the
mouths I miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing
with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time
goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have
never been funny , in my heart the only one that dissed
me was Sonia she took all our inheritance money , left
the rest of us to pick up the pieces. i never forgive
the way she betrayed us , there ent a big enough reason
before I sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing ,
but I guess that everyone's different or should I say
no one's perfect she had happiness in front of her but
chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing . Since you
gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is
my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but
it's hard when it's done I don't know what to expect,
so give me the strength that I need to perform this
task make it right I must do and I ask cause I trust
you it goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time
you know I never want to be alone ohh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace.
Can I say goodbye to you?
It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get
enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you
ohh how I miss you, It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I
miss you ohh how I miss you.

there ain't enough words to describe how sorry I am for
the pain that I caused sorry for when I stuck up my
own blood we were young he said I was rape and he broad
and for the day police came to the door , I'm sorry for
being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and
making you mourn , I never been able to say this
before cause I've was so inconsiderate you love me
unconditionally and I took advantage of it like a idiot
not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I
really hope that you can forgive me , you going away
was a punishment but I won't let go I'm holding you
with me but I still fight the emotions within me

You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or
feel the chill of your warm embrace.
Can I say goodbye to you?"
Ed Sheeran,Grade 8,"My mind is a worrier
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset

I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet

And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down

And I'm keeping on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, now

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, now

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow
For your weary head to lay to rest again

Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror
To take me to the edge again, now

And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down

I'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade 8
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down"
Ed Sheeran,Grow Back,"Fell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don't come round here
And chances are slim

But eventually
You'll be mine

Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim

But eventually
You'll be mine
I won't miss a thing
If you're mine

I don't care if you're lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we cant see this through
We can't fix this
Love
It wont grow back

She said its time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I'd regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren't even listening
I might be too much right now man it's sickening
Can't believe I'm running from her
I'm stranded, her beauty is too much to bear

And oh, I think I want her
And oh, I swear she's never been deep in before
And oh, I think I need her
I can't tell her I want her its not right in summer
I think that I need her

I won't miss one thing
If you're mine
I don't care if you're lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see is you
And I miss this
And we cant see this through
We can't fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we cant see this through
We can't fix this

Love, it wont grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby your love deals the hardest blows"
Ed Sheeran,Hallelujah (Feat. Nina Nesbitt),"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do ya
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah"
Ed Sheeran,Hands of Gold,"He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss

For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm"
Ed Sheeran,Hearts Don't Break Around Here,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me
When the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
None like most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flowin' Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Well, I've found love inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah"
Ed Sheeran,Hold On,"It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on"
Ed Sheeran,Homeless,"Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt

On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am

I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver turns the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong

Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am

I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

When I feel cold you keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose changes
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home, less than I'd like to be"
Ed Sheeran,How Would You Feel (Paean),"You are the one, girl
You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too"
Ed Sheeran,I Can't Spell,"I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can't spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I'm a different man with a different tune
I didn't find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
'Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close"
Ed Sheeran,I Don't Want Your Money (Ft. H.E.R.),"Hey, I waited for you all day

I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am more than a thousand miles away
And I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' ""There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times""
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

I used to be around more
But I was strapped for cash
That's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Trying to make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, ""Boy when you comin' home? ""
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
She keeps tellin' me over and over

(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(I just want your, I just want your time)

You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy you drive me crazy, you know, you know

I don't want your money, baby, oh
(I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time
(Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
(I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)

And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time"
Ed Sheeran,I Knew You Were a Trouble,"Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Till you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why"
Ed Sheeran,I Never Fell,"""Never Fell""

If you wanna put this on me, that's fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won't work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won't work
So can you help me out?

And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it's true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

See and I don't wanna take it to the get gate
Where I came fly show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back

I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn and I
I was blind to all
Yeah I saw all

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it's true
Cause I have fallen for you

Say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it's true
Cause I have fallen for you

Say if you love somebody new

Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now

I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, in my mind

I never fell for you, you tripped me"
Ed Sheeran,I See Fire (Kygo Remix),"If this is to end in fire
Then we shall burn together
Watch the flames climb higher into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me"
Ed Sheeran,I Will Take You Home,"I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home

Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn up
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm

And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive 'till these tires wear out
But darling I
I will take you home

If we could drive all night
Until the sun is showing
I see it in your eyes
They will take me home

Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home

And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned
And we will write all our memories down
And we will drive 'till these tires wear out

But darling, I
I will take you home
And we will drive 'till the tires run out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'till this fire is drowned

But darling I
I will keep you warm
darling I
I will keep you warm
darling I
I will take you home"
Ed Sheeran,I'm a Mess,"Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end

I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions
Going through us

And though I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined

I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I loved my lover
For how long I loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I loved my lover
For how long, long I loved my lover
(Feel it all over now)
For how long, long I loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I loved my lover
(Feel it all over now)
For how long I loved my lover
(Feel it all over now)
For how long, long I loved my lover

(Feel it all over now)
For how long, long I loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I loved my lover"
Ed Sheeran,I'm Glad I'm Not You,"It's been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All that's left is shattered hearts
It's plain enough for us to see that
You've got me
You've got me

We're just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It's no fuss
I'm not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You've got me
You've got me

We're just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It's no fuss
I'm not in love

I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer's touch
It's true
I'm glad I'm not you"
Ed Sheeran,In Memory,"I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won't forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept

Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head

And I know that you're gone

The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind

Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head

And I know that you're gone

Goodbye"
Ed Sheeran,In My Life,"There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compared with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more"
Ed Sheeran,Insomniac's Lullaby,"I'm getting very edgy
Cos you're trying to take this from me
And it's something that I wanted so bad
Cos you're the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you're a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It's your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week

I've grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you're not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don't care as long as you're mine
It's happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week

And I'm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can't sleep although I think I can
It's insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I'm not your man?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I'm losing sleep
I live only for the week"
Ed Sheeran,King Of The Kings,"Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of a killer
The soul of the meek
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name

Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage
when fooled by the liars?
King of the kings do you feel any pain?
Do you feel any pain?
Do you feel any pain?"
Ed Sheeran,Last Night,"I went out late last night,
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet

And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out

Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now

I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here

Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight,
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within

And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight

This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out,
I'm never gonna leave here

Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now

I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here

Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold,
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without you"
Ed Sheeran,Lately (Feat. Devlin),"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)

[Verse 4: Devlin]
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed""
What less did you bloody expect from 'em? ""
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake

I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately"
Ed Sheeran,Leave Your Life,"If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I-I'm, I'm never gonna leave your life

Oh, I could never tell you lie
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again

Oh, I'm, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I-I'm, I'm never gonna leave your life

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love will keep alive
I'm never gonna leave your life
I-I I'm, I'm never gonna leave your life

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?"
Ed Sheeran,Lego House,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

And three words have
Two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in the cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in

If things go right
We could frame it
And put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in the cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broke then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now"
Ed Sheeran,Let It Out,"You give me life like lots of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss, and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out now, now

You speak me to me behind your Dublin [unverified] step
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

It's you I miss and it's you I miss
So let it out, let it out, now
I let it out, I let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn part, you see we were just like glue

We're like glue

So let it out, let it out, now
Let it out, let it out, now, now

It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue"
Ed Sheeran,Little Bird,"If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come in side for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing.
But when I wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now
And let me hold ya, ohh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon.
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird.
My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say it's late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all this thing I'm sure of,
I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream, but then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'cause that leads to regret, diving into soon.
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa
My little bird
My little bird

You're my little bird..."
Ed Sheeran,Little Lady (feat. Mikill Pane),"(verse 1 - mikill pane)

Listen
Little lady, this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
It's 30 degrees, thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes
Lady the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you no your legs will ache if you try
& you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the whittington were they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know your fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman
The pimp see's you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal
'cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him
'cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

(chorus - ed sheeran)

She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
& she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly.

(verse 2 - mikill pane)

Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injurys you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stiched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise if you stared him in the face anyway
'cos all the heroin is making you age
But your a heroin for taking the strain of being a prostitue and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using moneygram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know your never coming back
She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state the summer fans
See that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle, damn.

(chorus - ed sheeran)

She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
& she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes & hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight,
Straight down the line.

(verse 3 - mikill pane)

Little lady, your trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles the dear
Your sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it,
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
Your causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The coppers trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, who you working for?
He's talking to like your worth more than a dirty whore
Your having a conversation you could be murdered for
Your learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He's useless if your gonna be stupid
'cos an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, your on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says 'where you been bitch? I wanna know.'
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your albibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his merc in the street.
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 30th birthday

(chorus - ed sheeran)

& we're all under the upper hand
& go mad for a couple grams
& we don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'cos in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly."
Ed Sheeran,London Bridge (Performed with Yelawolf),"(Yelawolf)
There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind
Then came the dead
Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing

(Ed Sheeran)
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

(Yelawolf)
I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound

(Ed Sheeran)
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
(x4)

And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
(x2)

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down"
Ed Sheeran,Love In Slow Motion,"It's been a while since we've been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment, I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling, that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize-ize

If there's one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

In slow motion
In slow motion"
Ed Sheeran,Make It Rain,"When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of canes
Even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain

And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well all be in vain
Even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain

And the seas are full of water
It stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

And let the claps fill with thunderous applause
And let the lightning be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain, make it rain"
Ed Sheeran,Masters Of War (Bob Dylan Acoustic Cover),"Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

And you've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch as you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
To make sure that you're dead"
Ed Sheeran,Merry Christmas (With Elton John),"Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God! You look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas everyone

(Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah)

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God! You look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

I feel it when it comes
Every year, helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends are together
Where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

(Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah)

It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmastime"
Ed Sheeran,Misery,"Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me

In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me

In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me

In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery"
Ed Sheeran,Miss You,"Shock, horror, I'm down
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on auto-pilot
And my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you
And I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
And my belly's sick to it's stomach
When I remember all the times
He was with you when you laid it down
When you laid down
Next to me

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you, far too long
I'll let go, as soon as you do
See, I know we're not through

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you"
Ed Sheeran,Moody Ballad Of Ed,"Come on now
Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away"
Ed Sheeran,Move On,"Now it seems I've been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there's only up, there ain't no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold

What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain't no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up!

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who ?what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?"
Ed Sheeran,Nancy Mulligan,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said: ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, met her at Guy's in the Second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border"
Ed Sheeran,Nando's Song (With Example),"I said, oi you are you gonna bang doe
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat it up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle
and he's gonna show you how he do

Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favorite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them things

Yo, and we eat chicken for free
'Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and

All them things that are nice
(One sec... keep going...)
Nandos from me, fat chance I've gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometimes on a Tuesday, sometimes on a Thursday (yo)
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways

Yeah, I said we are on tour so him I'm like
Get out the store, yo!
'Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate nandos from your car
Can't freestyle 'cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face 'cause like I'm like Febreze... Yar!

Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone

I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's (I said ohh)
I love Nando's

My tongue is on fire
I wanna say hell yeah, (yes Ed)
Nando's I desire (I give it to you anytime you want babe)
I want some free Nando's from your black card

You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
My wallet, my wallet (I wanna take your black card)
You ain't getting my wallet

And I gain ten pounds everytime I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nando's for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity socket
To get your hair up like this

Your never touching my card, this is my card
Your never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me play your guitar
Step to me hard you ain't getting my card star

I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's, (right now)
I want some Nando's right now"
Ed Sheeran,New Man,"Nah nah nah nah nah

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet
And watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked
And his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram
And I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder
But I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack
I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors
In winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gang sign
Says ""Tune, boydem light up the room! ""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps
But you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club
Kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it
You can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man"
Ed Sheeran,New York,"Oo Oo woahh ohh ohhohh now now

Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room

Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?

Or maybe we should take a ride
Through the night
And sing along to every song
That's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no no no
The sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3am
So Dj, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

In New York

Yesterday you gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast

And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline now
It's just the way that life goes
And you live it in every song you know
So Dj, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new life
In New York

And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying that it's a waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight

In New York
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
Now we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything if you want

A new love
In New York

A new life
In New York"
Ed Sheeran,"Nightmares (feat. Random Impulse, Sway & Wretch 32)","They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me

You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
The haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than I need it
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I hear shit, cousin I am deaf
Gang signs I'm a N A reading
I'm a Ceo, man you suckers are next

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Ch'yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me!"
Ed Sheeran,Nina,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat
Is where we used to stay
Just watching the Dvd, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites, we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane
Or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now

And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh , won't you leave me now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
And as if we were two rabbits and then you vanish
Back to burrow all of the celtics are disappearing
You call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job before everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings
Will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick
Before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on a plane
But in the day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh , won't you leave me now

And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both
Oh , won't you leave me now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh , won't you leave me now

And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both
Oh , won't you leave me now"
Ed Sheeran,No Diggity / Thrift Shop (Feat. Passenger),"Shorty, get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, cocaine by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(Say what)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, ain't no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
It's always she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Let me come in, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

She's got class and style
And balance by the pound
Shorty, never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curves the words, spins the verbs
Lovin' it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You never quite know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Top notch, Trumped tight, every day
You're blowing my mind, baby, in time
Maybe, I can get you in my ride

Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark

Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away

No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'm gonna go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart

No lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark (no lo-lo-love)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely (love for the lonely)
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark"
Ed Sheeran,No Luck,"I'm screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place

we'd flirt
And you'd treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
you're better off with me

we're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
you're better off with me

we're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass"
Ed Sheeran,Nothing on You (Ft. Dave & Paulo Londra),"I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
Mean it, why don't you turn off the lights?
So I don't wanna leave here ever, no
She was like ""Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance
And you and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Uh, uh)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones con flow)

Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, uh
Quiero comentarle que no sé que pasó, uh
Desde que salimo' por la tarde los dos
A besarnos los dos, hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemos los dos, no se puede igualar
Parecemos ficción, cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor, no se puede acabar, yeah
Pero lo que mata
Es que esta noche no' vemo', y en mi casa
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the rover
Casa Cruz, Casablanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

I was rolling off something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

She was like ""Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
She was like ""Damn
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
Want to be your man
""Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
She was like ""Damn
And you ain't got nothing on you"""
Ed Sheeran,Oh No,"I think it's written on a notebook somewhere
Can you feel it as you breathe the night air
Yeaah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was ha-ard ha-ard hard for you to speak
Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood
Yeaah

Let's just continue what we used to do
Because I know it was ha-ard ha-ard hard to see the truth
And it's laate
It's laate
I can't let go (oh no)
I miss you (oh no)
I can't let go (oh no)
I miss you (oh no)
OOh (oh no) x4

Drift off into space without care (oh no)
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer*
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Because I know it was ha-ard ha-ard hard to see the truth
Sleep tight and I will now wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love heey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Because I know it was ha-ard ha-ard hard to see the truth

And it's late
It's late
I can't let go (oh no)
I miss you (oh no)
I can't let go (oh no)
I miss you (oh no)
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go"
Ed Sheeran,One,"Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me

And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave

And would you take away my hopes and dreams
And just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one

And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my heart and soul
I will only have these eyes for you

And you know, everything changes
But we'll be strangers
If we see this through

You can stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one

And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk
Getting myself lost
I am so gone

So tell me the way home
I'm listening sad songs
Singing about love
Where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one

And all my friends have come to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one"
Ed Sheeran,One Life,"It's such a beautiful night
to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side
talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?

What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change
now the moment of truth

Why am I feeling so nervous?
When things are going so perfect
But I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, and get on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time
just to make it right
So I'll ask you, tonight
will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

A gentle touch of the hand
fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life

Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night
one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way
to fall in deeper in with you

Why was I feeling nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it's worth it
To spend forever with you

So I count to three, I get on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I'll ask you, tonight
will you marry me?
Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be

Your hand in mine
Some things were just meant to be
Hearts intertwined
Some things were just meant to be
In perfect time
Some things were just meant to be
Oh, you and I
Some things were just meant to be"
Ed Sheeran,One Night,"Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, then I'll tell her myself

And we've got love in us
So if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don't really dance
So I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don't mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you're wearing
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

She's like the fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she's all I need

Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself"
Ed Sheeran,Open Your Ears,"Can't get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I'll say what I don't mean

In your world we were the same
In mine now you're the one to blame
You can't remember my name
We're lost, it's such a shame

Listen to me (yeah yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me (yeah yeah)
Stop making me see

I'm strong yet proud
I'm quiet yet loud
And I'm everything
You want in me
I'm small yet tall I have it all
And I'm everything
You want me to be

Listen to me (yeah yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me (yeah yeah)
Stop making me see

And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I'm on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

Listen to me (yeah yeah)
Stop making me see
What I've been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me see"
Ed Sheeran,Pause (feat. Alonestar),"You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you're spinning my track
That'll knock you off your feet

Monkey see what monkey do
But I'm a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up
We won't stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on

This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who d'you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow - blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed - keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took so long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on"
Ed Sheeran,Penguins,"Met her smoking a cigarette
In a toilet cubicle
Ripped dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful

Say the time and place to start a future
And, darling, I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere

Oh, darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human?
It's what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
'Cause I have felt disabled

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

She told me about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined

We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls

Oh, darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?

And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
but God knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
Can you feel the love in mine?"
Ed Sheeran,Photograph (Felix Jaehn Remix),"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
Ed Sheeran,Pony,"I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise you, won't want to get off

If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it

Sittin' here, flossin'
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
I'll send shivers up and down your spine
And fluids flowin' down your thigh

If your horny lets do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it

Wanna get freaky, baby
And feel you next to me
And you can join jockey team
Wanna get nasty, baby
And feel you next you me
And you can join my jockey team
Oh

If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
Come and jump on it
If your horny, lets do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddles waitin'
Come and jump on it"
Ed Sheeran,Postcards,"Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I'm so frustrated, so dilated
And she's telling me I've wasted my time
And I'm running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, 'cos I won't mind
I doubt if I even know that I'm awake

And still you're singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we're asking for so much more
Now you're bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor"
Ed Sheeran,Put It All on Me (Ft. Ella Mai),"Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you
You make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and you start to say

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week
Or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whatever you need
You need, you need
To put it all on me

All on me, all on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, all on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, all on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need
To put it all on me

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (Hey)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (Oh)
I know it hasn't been your day or week
Or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whatever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (Babe)

All on me, all on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (Slow)
All on me, all on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, all on me (On me)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need (Need)
So put it all on me

I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love"
Ed Sheeran,Quiet Ballad of Ed,"In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams

Things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all

Still things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better"
Ed Sheeran,Radio (feat. JME),"Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a part
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think, JME just do one tune, make a couple cheese and chill
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this,
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, I'm fair, straight
Who can tell me different? you could be determined
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this

[Chorus]
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cos I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Cant shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why does that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or lump it, this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?

I never had a playlist in my heart, ooh
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark? ooh
Are you gonna play me though? this song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? If this song's not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh"
Ed Sheeran,Remember the Name (feat. 50 Cent & Eminem),"Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money
Then my conversation's shifting
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb
From the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed them
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good
Well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought
I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

I can still remember (What?)
Tryna to shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yup)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?)
If I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?)
Put Nine Inch Nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splittin' seams of Denim
When I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if"", ""and, "" or ""butts""
Are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me
'Cause you're only fucking with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed
It isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me, I
Dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shining wrist with the rocks on it
Buscemi's with locks on it
Anything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money
What else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out
The king brings you 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check
Worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to get super lit
Boy, I'm kicking straight facts
That's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ed Sheeran,River,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susan""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand
Turned in two-night stand
He was calling so might scram
Now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh) , my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh) , watch the river run
Call me (ooh) , call me (ooh)
River (ooh) , we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey! ""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I made they came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
Well, I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie
To tell a unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one (I'm sorry) , I don't wanna admit to something
(I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
Ed Sheeran,Runaway,"I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morn-in' go

How long you leaving
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway,but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say cos he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morn-in, go
How long you leaving
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway,but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own

Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack, intends to show love

I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold up
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say cos he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own"

Ed Sheeran,Sandman,"You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hanging out with the sandman

Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

We're hanging out with the sandman
We're hanging out with the sandman
We're hanging out with the sandman"
Ed Sheeran,Sara,"Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind

Hey now
'Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
Even with that soul

Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you

And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
'Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that

May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your day"
Ed Sheeran,Saturday,"On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work

There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today

Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love

There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today

There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today"
Ed Sheeran,Save Myself,"I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money
And now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles
But would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter
And a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache
And in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so
I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink
And out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me
They just left me on the shelf
No farewell

So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are
Destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon
'Cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so
I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink
And out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me
They just left me on the shelf
No farewell

So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

But if don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so
I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink
And out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me
They just left me on the shelf
No farewell

So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else
I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else
I've got to love myself"
Ed Sheeran,Scars,"You got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever, you know
You can start again like this, like this

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So We'll beat it away, coloring the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing the blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to let any dream
And replace it with anything better
So, get up
And take away your scars

You can never be alone, if you are bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high, that's why...

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So We'll beat it away, coloring the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing the blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to let any dream
And replace it with anything better
So, get up
And take away your scars

I can take away your scars
I can take away your scars"

I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever
who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing
they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing
we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done

Girl, stop curbing the question
I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options
and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you"
Ed Sheeran,She,"I paid all my dues and she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her now I'm ready to go
As strange as it seems, she's endless to me
She's just like paperwork but harder to read

Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans and as she has made hers
She kept me in mind but I wasn't sure
I searched every room for a way to escape
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for delight
And blocking my way

Patience's my enemy, loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend

Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand she already understands everything
""Won't you stay?"", she says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands I'll stay, anyway

'Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself

Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself, I know myself
I know myself"
Ed Sheeran,"She Looks So Perfect (5sos Cover, Capital Live Session)","Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young
Now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard
For this just to give it up now

If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's
Only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
I made a mix-tape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans
lying on the floor
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now, that I'm so down"
Ed Sheeran,Shirtsleeves,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made

I'll hold ya and you think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When the salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes

I still taste salt water
Oh my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you
These cuffs are covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When the salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth

Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I'm on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry
But I'm drowning in the oceans you made

When the salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be fully tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes"
Ed Sheeran,Sing,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side now
I've been sat with you
For most of the night

Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be my lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days

Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray

I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know that she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep
If anybody find out
I meant to drive home
But I drank all of it now
Not sober enough, we just sat on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Louder
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Sing
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Oh no

Sing

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (sing)

If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Sing"
Ed Sheeran,Skinny Love,"Skinny love
Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different ""kind""
'cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
Now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the bridges
And at the end of all your lines


Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?"
Ed Sheeran,Small Bump,"You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months
you'll open your eyes

And I'll whisper quietly and give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly and tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
Ed Sheeran,Smile,"Just give me a pen and I'll write my worries
Now and again I'll try and not see that you don't care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life's bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

They've written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don't care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don't care

And hey, I don't speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile"
Ed Sheeran,So,"Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need your smile
And your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need your smile
And your kiss

'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

These words I say mean
You're so amazing
I've noticed lately
I need you, maybe

These words I say mean

Ed Sheeran,Sofa,"She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again

And we're both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

When the morning comes
We're not watchingFormula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with
Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again

And we're still so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya Paris, Rome, to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word, and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa, with you"

Ed Sheeran,Spark,"Take me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?

The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark

We'd be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That depends
Will you be my friend?

The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark"
Ed Sheeran,Starving,"You know just what to say
Somethings that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet
The more that I know you
The more I want to
Somethings inside me changed
I was so much younger yesterday

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don't need butterflies
When you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way
By the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

Na na na na na na na na
Starving till I tasted you
Na na na na na na na na
Starving till I tasted you

You know just how to make
My heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake
Bring on disaster
You hit me head-on and got me weak in my knees
And somethings inside me changed
I was so much younger yesterday
So much younger yesterday

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don't need butterflies
When you give me the whole damn zoo

I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love
'Cause I'm just a man

These nights never seem to
Go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Can you hold my hand?

Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look
Need some self control
And deep down, I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

Oh, won't you stay with me?

Who turned into a man

Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take

Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you're winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song

Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe"
Ed Sheeran,Stop The Rain,"Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown, but for me, they look the same
Sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another ""I, me, mine"" to blur the lines between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right and always shiftin' blame
And every time it's getting more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let them tell you ""Keep it all inside""
I know the winds have got to change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seem like time
Can be so much more than a wake-up call into live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over, read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the rain clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop the rain, yeah, can't stop the rain, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know you can't stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Ed Sheeran,Sunburn,"You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes
And I saw her staring back at me
So I will try and find another one
Who suits me as well as her

I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that would be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear, woah

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
And if you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you"
Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards
And stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me
""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces
It's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Fluffed the pillows, made the beds
Stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive
Then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back he'll say, ""Hallelujah
You're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back he said, ""Hallelujah
You're home"""
Ed Sheeran,Sweet Mary Jane,"I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

I drill you deep into my chest
That's where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
'Cause I don't want to be alone

'cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off
Of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing another song

Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
'Cause I don't want to be alone

'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off
Of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song

Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song

Mary Jane
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane
Since you came along
Mary Jane
I'm almost home
Mary Jane
Sing another song

'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off
Of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song

'Cause everyday that I'm breathing, sweet Mary Jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song"
Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper; I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never want to get bitten
Because plagiarism is sin
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision

Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you
Over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter

For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me
Grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old I moved out of my home
I was Macey Gray I tried to say goodbye and
I choked
And we've been sleeping at the subway station
Sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't want to relax
But would it hurt your reputation
If I put it on wax?
So take it back now

C'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
Ooh

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
And my back pack I'll be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when
I'm running the school
I'll make a beat with my feet
By just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
And keeping the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham
When he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I'll be willing to start again at the end of the song
Still they claim that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy, except for Nme
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as
The magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
And healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
I'm battling with respect
I don't know if I'll have it
This songs from the heart
Grabbing the plaque
I'll take it back now

C'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
Ooh

Take it back now
I don't ever want to be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
I accept the fact that
Someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
Screaming out vocally
Might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with Mcdaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we put it out
It's time to take it back now

C'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
Ooh

C'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
Ooh"

Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past

Believing things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha

Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Hey, I oughta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way"
Ed Sheeran,Take Me Back to London (feat. Stormzy),"Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride) , he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guys
Give me a pack of the crisps and my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, travelled a billion miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)

So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, ma
it's never enough
‘Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)

Birmingham, 0121. stand up
You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bag for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Trip chunning man choose for the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed 'til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze cos I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild wild west with the old western, it's Brum

Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggot
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it, snap it
Bap bap, that's that, trap, rap to mappy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break

It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace'
I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no, more she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more she wants Aitch (Aye)
Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh)
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
And anything, I'm gonna put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead

Ed Sheeran,Take Me To Church (Hozier Cover At The Live Lounge),"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece
Every sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me: worship in the bedroom
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

To drain the whole sea get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?

We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence
Than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog
At the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good god, let me give you my life"
Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
they just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word
and they'll all disappear into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love

Lumiere, darlin'
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin'
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin'
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin'
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin'
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darlin'
Lumiere over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you better"
Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upperhand
Go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside

For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die"
Ed Sheeran,The City,"The city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens beat through my window cill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into

This town is alive
With lights that blind keep me awake
Put my hood up, unlace and tie
The street fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveller Ohoohohh
This is now my home, My home
Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It'll take me where I need to go
If I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to

The shop across the road
It fills my needs and keeps me company
When I need it
Voices beat through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveller Ohoohohh
This is now my home, My home
Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sounds of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this, To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I
Need to move alone

London calls me a stranger
This is now my home, Home

Oh Woah
Burning on the back street
Oh Woah
Stuck here, sitting in the back seat
Oh Woah
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't upto you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two"
Ed Sheeran,The Man,"No I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cos I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public its nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with
in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack
So casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cos I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left
I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is 24/7
I fell like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cos I still love you and I need you by my side
If I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts
That I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27
I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing
It's only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared
But I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change
Take my apology
I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore"
Ed Sheeran,The Parting Glass,"Of all the money that e'er I had, I spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done, alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit, to memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass. goodnight and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er
I had, they're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot that
I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call,
""goodnight and joy be with you all!""

A man may drink and not be drunk,
a man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
and perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ordered been
by a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass,
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all"
Ed Sheeran,The Sea,"Pass me a drink
You say it's gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile

You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette

You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I've taken the blow
It's all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no? see you later?

You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile

You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette

You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea"
Ed Sheeran,The West Coast Of Clare,"Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again

In Milltown there's a pub
It's there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they'll return again

I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there"
Ed Sheeran,These Dreams,"I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you
Amongst the other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises
That I'm covering

Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away
From the pain
And now you sit before me with a folder
Holding my story, you're my savior with nothing on me
But power and glory

And surely you'll never ignore me
'cause when the the call came
The court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me
But never what I went through
But you were never meant to I won't hold it against you

I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not never let me stop
You'll just sit and watch it's your job to be patient
So you'll let me off

So come with me take a walk on the wild side
See life in a day through a child's eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away
Away

Okay, session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson
And I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what?
I still find this trigonometry a head fuck

Constantly told I won't pass my gcse's
I'll end up in micky d's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em

Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling bill bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it hard to do
So after school you'll take me shopping
For some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me
When I get back to the group home

So come with me take a walk on the wild side
See life in a day through a child's eyes
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me
When sleep's the only thing
That I want to take me away, away"
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud (Alex Adair Remix),"When your legs don't look like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

Darlin' I will be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
Baby my heart could still fall as hard
At twenty three

When my hair's over grown and my memory fades
And the crowds don''t remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mm)
I know you will still love me the same

Cause honey your soul
Could never grow old
It's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud

Ed Sheeran,This,"This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one that make me loose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I throw it all away
Watched you fall into my arms again
And I throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I throw it all away
Watched you fall into his arms again
And I throw it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back for...

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new"
Ed Sheeran,Tone (Performed With Yelawolf),"(Yelawolf)
Yeah, slumdon bridge
Mr. red, catfish
Back me up
Let's go

I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target
Demolish it
Don't jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat
Like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds
With the speech? obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy
That's several pauses
You might need a coffin
With holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again
He's all asleep in coffin, man
I'm all, they all that's been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I'm harder than titanium brass plates
That are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I'm astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track
Strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave's that's what I made
Got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does [?] or they [?]
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves
What I'm trying to say is, it's my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built a bridge, the slumdon bridge, holla!"
Ed Sheeran,Touch,"You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I never felt
The way you got me under your spell
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons
And now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long?
(Wait so long)
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell
But don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons
And now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself (to yourself)

Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

And now my whole week, my whole week is golden
Can you see me glowing?
That's how I feel
And I'm not afraid to feed into emotions
'Cause I know that this could be something real

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week

Ed Sheeran,Touch and Go,"Waking up
Midnight, november
And you're still in my bed

It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home
We can talk about the pitifuls of the road

If you said ""go""
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke

Oh, my soul
Lately, I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be touch and go

It's not enough to say ""I want ya""
'Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out to feel without a doubt
I have just been questioned, yeah

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home
We can talk about the pitifuls of the road

If you said ""go""
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke

Oh, my soul
Lately, I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go
Oh, my soul
How long, how long can we be

All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling, my soul, believe

If you said ""go""
I would stop everything, oh
My heart would play the role
And act like it's never been broke

Oh, my soul
Lately, I really need to know
How long, how long can we be touch and go

How long, how long can we be touch and go

I'm like ""hey, what's up, hello""
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 50, 60 grand, 500 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go

Ed Sheeran,Two Blokes and a Double Bass,"Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I'd wager that you're gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said 'You and your big cheeks have got me'
Along with 'Disarm' and 'Flooded Quarry'
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room's hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain't wrong
He's got me singing to 'Amerikan Folk Song'
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don't talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
Jp beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain't no fake, it's music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout 'Wow!'
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name's Nizlopi, then there ain't much to it
'Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now"
Ed Sheeran,Two Different Worlds,"I live in two different worlds
Like lots of other boys and girls
One's at home with my family and the other's school
Where I learn all that I can be

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
In home I can speak whenever I please
I can talk real loud and shoot the breeze
At school I raise my hand in the air
When there's something that I want to share

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
At home I can sit here and there
In the couch, my bed or easy chair
In school I have a special place
My desk, and that's my learning space

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds

School got more rules
Because learning is a goal
Learning takes focus, so you need self control

In home I move wherever I like
I can run around and ride my bike
In school we have a different way
We stand in line everyday

At home we go
At school we go
At home we go
At school we go

I live in two different worlds
I live in two different worlds
Home and school are two different worlds
Two awesome worlds"
Ed Sheeran,Typical Average,"Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?

Ed Sheeran,U.N.I,"I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes

Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another ""like you""
Sleep with my thoughts and I dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward

Like our last kiss it was perfect
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day
We fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I'm thinking I'm unaware
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around to make sure
I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied"
Ed Sheeran,Undone,"Made of clay
Shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun

I lost my way
So help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So it's up to you
For you to bring those words

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time

This grief you give
It takes it's toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time"
Ed Sheeran,Wake Me Up,"I should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
Just replace it
See, I could do without
A tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to grey
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know, just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty?
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love shrek
'Cause we've watched it twelve times
But, maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your dvd breaks today
You should've gotten a VCR
'Cause I've never owned a blue-ray, true say

And I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd got cross
Then chuck all the controllers at the tv
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me, if I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me, 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know, just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try get me to stop
You drink as much as me, and I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me, is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
You just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now

So maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love
When you woke me up"
Ed Sheeran,Way Home,"Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He's slowly finding a way back home

He had a family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he's one dog who don't want a bone
He's slowly finding a way back home

He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what's mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He's slowly finding a way back home

His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He's slowly finding a way back home

His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown
This man who's finding a way back home

So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's june
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He's slowly finding a way back home

Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man with regrets lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He'll never find a way back home"
Ed Sheeran,Way to Break My Heart (feat. Skrillex),"Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout her

And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my—

First love never dies
Guess I'll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

Ed Sheeran,Wayfaring Stranger,"Oooh ooh ooh
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright light to which I go
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now

Hey eý ey yeah
Mmmm
Ooohhh

I know dark clouds will gather me
I know my way's rough and steep
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
And I know my way's rough and steep
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now

Coz I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright light to which I go
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going home now"
Ed Sheeran,We Are,"(Ohh ohh) (x7)

Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry

(Ohh ohh)

I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes

(Ohh ohh)

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

(Ohh ohh) (x5)

I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowed has gathered
All around
No ones speaking
No one makes a sound
And I

And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone

Alone now... (x5)

They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same

We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone"
Ed Sheeran,We Found Love (Rihanna Cover live at Siriusxm),"Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place"
Ed Sheeran,What Do I Know,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quarrels""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children
They will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life
Is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar
Grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment"
Ed Sheeran,Where We Land,"Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I’m next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s freefall
See where we land

It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s freefall
And see where we land"
Ed Sheeran,Who You Are (Jessie J Cover),"I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

(Who you are, who you are, who you are)

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try, the less it's working
Cause everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are

Yes, nos, egos
Fake shows like woo
Just go, and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
With a smile
That's my home, yeah
That is my home

No, no, no, no, no
Don't lose who you are, in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Yeah, yeah"
Ed Sheeran,Wild Mountain Thyme,"Oh the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And I will build my love a bower
And yon pure crystal fountain
And around it I will place
All the colors of the mountain
Would you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
Would you go, lassie, go?

And If my true love's gone
I will surely find another
And to her I will sing
Things that make her know I want her

Would you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around blooming heather

Would you go, lassie, go?"
Ed Sheeran,Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd cover),"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here"
Ed Sheeran,Wonderwall (Oasis Cover),"Today was gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should of somehow
realized what you've got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Mmhm

Back beat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you've never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things
That I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should of somehow
realized what you've got to do
Well I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that
I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall
Oahh

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all you're my wonderwall

Mm, mm, mhmm (x4)"
Ed Sheeran,Yellow Pages,"I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can't forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it's the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren't translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I'd be free from it

See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I'm back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it's the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren't translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I'd be free from it"
Ed Sheeran,You (Feat. Wiley),"The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone

And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say ""Yes Nan""
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying ""Yes Nan""
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night

And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you"
Ed Sheeran,You Break Me,"Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you're too cold
And she said 'I can put away all those lies
And show you there's no surprise in me'

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that's what's going on

'Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

You break me"
Ed Sheeran,You Don't Know (feat. Yelawolf),"(Yelawolf)
For fuck's sake

(Ed Sheeran)
Living the life of a student
Yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five
Eh

(Yelawolf)
It's kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain, oh, main
Toddle some mud, under my door
You know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down, down, down
Making you go low, inside

(Ed Sheeran)
You don't know, if you don't know by now
You better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it?
Yeah, yeaaaah

(Yelawolf)
Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favour for your thirst
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise allah
To the wheels I'm a ridah
Steering your prada
Only closed in my ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa

(Ed Sheeran)
Back with my bang yo, straight loop on my ?
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show, I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
I'm riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo

(Yelawolf)
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tee's, you still huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact, what you used to steal from
You been playing fools, like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game, when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still son
Woah, this old rock, it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas and they hammer the ?

(Hook)
You don't know, if you don't know by now
You better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout it?
Yeah, yeaaaah

(Yelawolf)
I'm not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
60 seconds I'm going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
It's probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds ?
Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans
But really who's a friend?
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war
You don't want it
Shady records I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit

Dog don't gotta lead
Dog's already home
Jack, dog I'm a beast, I'm a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Shhh, tell him how we gonna sell 'em man

Been working hard all week
(So if you wonder if we earned it, well its not a probably)
So won't you bring that back to me
(And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a halloween)
I got blisters on my feet
(To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing)
So won't you bring that back to me
(Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings)

If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no
If you don't know, if you don't know, no, no, no"
Ed Sheeran,"You Need Me, I Don't Need You","Now I'm in town break it down
Thinking' of making' a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That's you now ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no I wont hush
I say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See I'm true my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
I move to greener pastures
See I'm real I do it all it's all me
I'm not fake don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put give me the chance be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

Cos you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
At all you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
At all you need me

I sing I write my own tune and I write my
Own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer writer you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to brits' school
I came fast with the way I act right
I can't last if I smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger, than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live it feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer writer like a gabriella cilmi

Cos you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
Until you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
Until you need me

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name is in light
Stadium heights with damien rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short heigh, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
yeah the game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you could be the lyrics when I'm singing them out
From day one, I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to this sofa giving a dose
Of what the future holds
Cos' it's another day, plus
I keep my last name forever keep the genre
Pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces
I'm selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in
An elevator

Cos you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
At all you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
At all you need me

Man, I don't need you"
Ed Sheeran,You Need To Cut Your Hair,"Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I'm a bad influence, that'll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
ajust don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl's trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you're a bad influence, that'll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don't talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don't be slow
This'll only take a mo'
Take yourself right out of my door

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone

This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you're a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don't see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2d
The only thing that's free in life is love
And that don't come cheap

It's just that they don't care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don't reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don't give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl's trouble"
Kodaline,All I Want,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die as a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But if you loved me
Why did you leave me
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

'Cause you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But if you loved me
Why did you leave me
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

But if you loved me
Why did you leave me
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you"
Kodaline,Brother,"When we were young
We were the ones the kings and queens
oh yeah we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes, man no regrets
wish I could re live every single word

We've taken different paths
and travelled different roads
I know we'll always end up on the same one
when we're old
And when we're in the trenches
and you're under fire I will cover you

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs
so you could breathe

I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother

Oh brother we go deeper than the ink
beneath the skin of our tattoos
No we don't share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you
that's the truth

We're living different lives, heaven only knows
If we'll make it back
with all our fingers and our toes
Five years, twenty years come back
we'll always be the same

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs
so you could breathe

I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother

And if we hit on troubled water
I'll be the one to keep you warm and safe
And we'll be carrying each other
Until we say goodbye on our dying day

Because I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother
I've got you brother

If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs
so you could breathe

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh x 2"
Kodaline,High Hopes,"Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared
Of never feeling it again
But I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy

I remember it now
It takes me back to when it all first started
But I've only got myself to blame for it
And I accept that now
It's time to let it all go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy

But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go
Go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts
Of all the people who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick
But they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
And I do believe that

Yeah but I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go
Go out and start again
High hopes, oh, when it all comes to an end
Now the world keeps spinning
Yeah the world keeps spinning around

High hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go
Go out and start again
High hopes, oh
Yeah and the world keeps spinning
Yeah this world keeps spinning
How this world keeps spinning around"
Kodaline,The One,"Tell me
Tell me that you want me
And I'll be yours completely
For better or for worst
I know
We'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason
I wouldn't change it for the world
'Cause I know
The first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you
Let you slip away
And I
Still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today

You make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one

Life is easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for
What is yet to come
'Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces
Together making one

You make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one

When we are together
You make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
You know I never ever believed in love
I believed one day that you would come along

Free me

You make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's how I know you are the one
That's why I know you are the one"
Kodaline,The Riddle,"Sunday morning rain
together we're along again
And I can feel your breath
Beneath the sheets and on my skin
Come closer to me now
forget about the world outside
'Cause I could die right here
So kiss me like we're out of time

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch
gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all

Come on, do it again
Hold me like you did before
You got me hypnotised
We're all that we've been searching for
I see it in your eyes
And the way your curl your lip and smile
And I could die right here
So kiss me like we're out of time

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch
gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all

Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
I'll say it again
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours
I'll say it again
Your heart is my heart
And my heart is yours

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch
gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all"
Kodaline,Love Will Set You Free,"I'm sure you're probably busy
Getting on with your new life
So far away from
So far away from

When everything we used to say
Was wrong is now alright
Where has the time gone
Where has the time gone

If you're ever feeling lonely
If you're ever feeling down
You should know you're not the only one
'Cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders
And you're falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free

I took a long and lonely walk up to an empty house
That's where I've come from
Where have you come from
The more I live, the more I know, I've got to live without
This ain't no sad song
Life has to go on

If you're ever feeling lonely
If you're ever feeling down
You should know you're not the only one
'Cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders
And you're falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free

You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free
You know love will set you free

Ooh ohh, ooh oh oh
Ooh ohh, ooh oh oh
Ooh ohh, ooh oh oh
Ooh ohh, ooh oh oh

If you're ever feeling lonely
If you're ever feeling down
You should know you're not the only one
'Cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders
And you're falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
Love will set you free"
Kodaline,Spend It with You,"If we had one day on earth
Who would you spend it with?
If you could choose who wanted to kiss
Who would that be?

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare
If I could choose
I would spend every minute with you
With you, with you, with you
Spend it with you

When all of the trees fall down
And all the seas dry out
And when you're waving goodbye to all the world
Would you find me?

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare
If I could choose
I would spend every minute with you
With you, with you, with you
Spend it with you

I wanna believe
If tomorrow was not guaranteed
Minutes to spare
If I could choose
I would spend every minute with you
With you, with you, with you
Spend it with you
You, spend it with you"
Kodaline,Care,"I remember when you told me
Back when we were young
You and me could be forever
You and me were strong
So now we get up caught in
Losing side of everything
I'll remember when you told me

But you didn't have to tell me
I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice
You were stressed out
When you lashed out that night
No, it doesn't even matter
I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care

If we sit and talk it over we don't have to fight
Sometimes we still have our moments and our sleepless nights
Let's see what tomorrow brings
We can take on anything
If we sit and talk it over

But you didn't have to tell me
I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice
You were stressed out
When you lashed out that night
No, it doesn't even matter
I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives

'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care

I know, yeah, I know that you care
But you didn't have to tell me
I'll be honest
You're a nightmare at times
No, I didn't even notice
You're stressed out
When you lashed out that night
And it doesn't even matter
I'll be with you
For the rest of our lives
'Cause I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care
I know, yeah, I know that you care"
Kodaline,Hide and Seek,"I don't wanna be the one to try
Being someone else is not my style
There's a missing piece I'm trying to find
I don't know how, but you made me look twice

Sleep, I don't need no sleep
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go

Keep on asking, why is there divide?
I'm hanging on to see if we collide
And we don't need to know the place or time
As long as I am yours and you are mine

Sleep, I don't need no sleep
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
High, higher than the birds
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go

Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me

There's no hide and seek
I see you, see me
What's the mystery?
Give it up, let go
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
Give it up, let go"
Kodaline,Follow Your Fire,"I remember you and me
Back when we were 17
Drinking, kissing in the street
We couldn't get enough
I see you layin' there with me
Like my missing puzzle piece
Dreaming of what we could be
We couldn't make you up

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves
To make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Hung on your sleeve
You want your heart on it
Did you get out
I'm wondering where you are?
(Did you follow, follow your fire?)

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves
To make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
(Did you follow, follow your fire?)
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Hung on your sleeve
You want your heart on it
Did you get out
I'm wondering where you are?
(Did you follow, follow your fire?)
Did you follow your fire?

The time we stole your daddy's car
And drove around till' liquor door
We slept outside and feelin' spark
We couldn't get enough

We promised that we never part
On the tree, under the stars
We called our names into the bark
To be there when we're not

We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves
To make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Hung on your sleeve
You want your heart on it
Did you get out
I'm wondering where you are?
(Did you follow, follow your fire?)

Kodaline,Angel,"On a Wednesday morning in July
We dried our tears and we said goodbye
Another angel gone before her time
But she's still alive in our hearts and minds

You never know, you never know
What you've got until it's gone
But heaven knows that when we're old
She will be forever young

Tonight, we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight, she'll go where we can't go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

And there are things in life we can't explain
In the blink of an eye, everything can change
So just appreciate the little things
'Cause you never know what tomorrow brings

You never know, you never know
What you've got until it's gone
But heaven knows that when we're old
She will be forever young

Tonight, we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight, she'll go where we can't go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

There's an empty room at home
How can the world be so damn cold?
Together, we are not alone

Tonight, we send an angel home
Sing out and celebrate her song
Tonight, she'll go where we can't go
Sing out, sing out, sing out

On a Wednesday morning in July
We dried our tears and we said goodbye"
Kodaline,Blood and Bone,"I wish someone would explain to me
How losing you is gonna make me feel
Like someone shot a hole in me
And left me out for the wolves to eat

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Heey! heey! heey!
It's just not the same
Heey! heey! heey!

And I still drive by your old house
Fight back tears and turn the music loud
Your favorite song, my Lcd Soundsystem is always on repeat

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Heey! heey! heey!
It's just not the same
Heey! heey! heey!
I miss you today
Heey! heey! heey!
And I'd give it all away if I could get you back

And I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on

You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
Heey! heey! heey!
It's just not the same
Heey! heey! heey!
I miss you today
Heey! heey! heey!
It's just not the same
Heey! heey! heey!

And I can't hold on
And I can't hold on
And I can't hold on
And I

It's just not the same
I miss you today"
Kodaline,Moving On,"I met you on the corner of the street
I smiled before I even heard you speak
I can accept we're growing older
But I guess that's just the way it has to be
I wondered how you still remembered me
I heard you settled down and that you married happily
Do you remember when I told you
That I'd love you to the bottom of the sea?
Yeah I know I know it's over
But I guess that's just the way it has to be

Sometime in the future
Maybe we can get together
Maybe share a drink and talk awhile
And reminisce about the days when we were still together
Maybe somewhere further down the line
And I will meet you there
Sometime in the future we can share our stories
When we won't care about all of our mistakes
Our failures, and our glories
But until that day comes along I'll keep on moving on
I'll keep on moving on

It's funny how but it still bothers me
I know it's been so long
But I did not expect to see oh how beautiful you are
I guess that all that time apart has done you well
But hey I wish you all the best
And maybe someday we might even meet again

Sometime in the future maybe we can get together
Maybe share a drink and talk awhile
And reminisce about the days when we were still together
Maybe somewhere further down the line
And I will meet you there
Sometime in the future we can share our stories
When we won't care
About all of our mistakes, our failures, and our glories
But until that day comes along I'll keep on moving on
I'll keep on moving on"
Kodaline,Lost,"Take me away make it all better
If not for a day then maybe forever
Is it all in my head
'cause it's getting harder
But there's something you said that I never thought of

Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost

Lost
Lost
We are lost
We are lost

Maybe today it'll get better
I hear what you say we're in this together
Now I'm starting to see
Hoping and praying
We'll never win, win without playing

Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost

Lost
We still get lost
It's easy to get lost
We are lost
It's easy to get lost

We are ordinary people, we are lost
Ordinary people
We are ordinary people, we are lost
Lost
Lost"
Kodaline,Autopilot,"I'm trying to connect with you
To see the world the way you do
Try 'n' understand what's in your head
I'm hearing what you said

'Cause I wanted to say
When I see you this way
Don't ever let it break your heart
I'll go back to the start
I'll watch you fall apart

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right

If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find a missing piece
Not just a big relief

Maybe you lost control
Fallen into a hole
The way that it was before
It's all that you're looking for

You just need to take a step back

This autopilot kicking in
You're feeling like you'll never win
Hey maybe I can help you out
Don't fall into your doubt
I hear you screaming out

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right

If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find the missing piece
Not just a big relief

Maybe you lost control
Fallen into a hole
The way that it was before
It's all that you're looking for

A lover is all you need
Someone that you can read
Day in and day out
Means this one is all, all about

[Choir]
Somebody
You need
[x4]

Feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make you right

If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find the missing piece
[Choir]
Somebody that you need

Somebody
You need

Kodaline,Love Like This,"Running through the heat, heartbeat
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart
It feels right in the sun, the sun
We're running around, and round
Like nothing else could matter in our lives
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark in my life
Yeah you'll be gone
It's as simple as a change of heart
But I'm not gonna think about the future

A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind
I don't really mind at all

Skipping to the night
It gets dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the backstreets
Yeah you never noticed me
All that I was thinking about
Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory
As it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple
As a change in your heart
MM... Just as simple as a change of heart

I know now
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I
I know that a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I

Ooh oohh oohh oohh

I don't mind at all
A love like this won't last forever
A love like this (a love like this)
A love like this won't last forever
Woah ohh"
Kodaline,Wherever You Are,"You say you love me
You say you care
And when you're with me
My future's there

We get carried away in emotion
We get lost in each other's eyes
And we forget what we regret
As we cast our feels aside

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be

Forget the violence
Forget the world
I see you smilin'
I'm lost for words

We get carried away in emotions
We get lost in each other's eyes
And we forget what we regret
As we cast our fears aside

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be

That's where I'll be
I swear I'll be there

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be"
Kodaline,Perfect World,"1, 2, 3, 4

Touch gloves, yeah, it'll be alright
I always knew you had a heavy heart
Brother, brother
You're taking me back to the start

I saw your face in a photograph
Painting a picture of a better time
Brother, brother
You'll always be on my mind

Yeah

In a perfect world
In a perfect world
In a perfect, a perfect world

Touchdown to reality
It's not exactly what you had in mind, oh
Brother, brother
Was it only a matter of time

Yeah, oh

Maybe you've gotta let it be
Maybe time will tell, maybe you will see, oh

You really shouldn't take it too hard

Kodaline,War,"There's a war between my head and my heart
And I don't know which side to take

You know my heart was yours to break

And people try and calm me down
But I can never hear a sound
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa
Whoa-a-whoa-oo-o
Yeah

There are sirens screaming out behind my eyes
I hide 'em away 'cause I'm ashamed
Or maybe I'm just too shy to just speak up
Or I'm afraid of what you might say

And there's a war between my head and my heart
And I don't know which side to take"
Kodaline,Talk,"I can remember the good old days
When you and me used to hide away
Where the stars were shining
Or the sun was blinding our eyes

Yeah you filled up my glass
With promises that could never last
And I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind

And all of the things that we once said
They're not in my heart, they're in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
Let's put it to rest yeah, let it die

'coz we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now

The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah we're done

I heard you made your way downtown
To the place that I've been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd
But trying to keep my head down

Over time our wires crossed
Well you changed and truth got lost
All the things I would change if we could only rewind

You were a moment in life that comes and goes
A riddle, a rhyme that no one knows
A change of a heart, a twist of fate
Couldn't fix it, it's too late

'coz we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now

The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah we're done

Wooh
Ooh ooh ooh

We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now"
Kodaline,Everyone Changes,"We say that the hardest thing to do is say goodbye
This is the hardest thing (Hardest thing)
We tried to stitch it up and now I wonder why
Why is this happening to me?

But it wasn't right, yet another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life, maybe you and I
We'll be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be
I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes

You say you left everything behind all because of me
But I gave you everything
Dreaming of future's bliss
A child and a family
Did they ever mean a thing to you?

But it wasn't right, yet another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life, maybe you and I
We'll be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be
I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes

But it wasn't right, yet another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life, maybe you and I
We'll be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything that I'll never be
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be
I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes (Everyone)
Everyone changes"
Kodaline,Heart Open,"This is not a sad song, it's about the ones you love
One in every small crowd too afraid to open up, and talk
Feeling like a lost child, crying for mother's love
No one really knows why, happens to the best of us

Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
And you're not broken
So keep your heart open now
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
And you're not broken
So keep your heart open now

People on the outside, they don't understand what's up
(People on the outside, they don't understand what's up)
But can they understand when you don't even know enough? Enough
Feeling like a lost child, crying for mother's love
Always on the outside, too afraid to open up, and talk

Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
And you're not broken
To keep your heart open now
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you're someone else
But you're not broken
So keep your heart open now

Ooh, ooh
Keep your heart open and
Ooh, ooh
Keep your heart open and
Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
And you are not broken
So keep your heart open
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
Man, you're not broken
So keep your heart open"
Kodaline,Say Something,"I was scared
I was unprepared
I was not aware you were caught in a bubble
You and I had a drunken fight
on a Tuesday night downtown

Well, it cut so deep
When you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me
When it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please, say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

I would walk for you
I will climb just to keep you safe
and to keep you out of trouble
I'd do time for you, I would lie for you
I would die for you

Well, it cut so deep
When you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me
When it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please, say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Well, it cut so deep
When you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me
When it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please, say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Hmm, hmm
Hmm
Say something to me"
Kodaline,After The Fall,"People keep talking
But I can't hear a word they say
Life just keeps moving
The world gets stranger everyday

And, yeah, ""Time is on your side""
That's what people tell you
But I got to let you go

My head is saying
That this is for the better
I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
All I wanna do is let go

Sirens are screaming
But I can't hear a single sound
And I'm feeling uneasy
And I wait, and I wait
For a change to come around

I get the feeling that this is for the better
And I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go (Yeah)
All I wanna do is let go

Are you searching for an answer
Or just peace of mind?
When your life has lost its meaning
Maybe you need a little time

Are you searching for an answer
Or just peace of mind
When your life has lost its meaning
Maybe you need a little time"
Kodaline,All Comes Down,"I still hear the sound of that runaway train
Roll through my heart is lost lovers refrain
But I know in my heart I can never go back
To the way that we were on that runaway track

I see in my soul
That I know you were lying to me
I lose control
Oh I didn't know
Was I just too young?

Why do I feel so old?
'Cause I'm still so young

Yeah, but it all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you

If you see it
Why can you do it?
I am so alone tonight
And it's heartbreaking
Only choosing God would've saved you
Love is a battle oh oh oh
Everybody cries

It all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to you
(oh, oh, oh)

And if you're wondering why
The vision in my soul
And I feel so alone
Like I'm losing control, no
Am I just too young? Oh, yeah

Why do I feel so old?
'Cause I'm still so young

It all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you
(all comes down to you)

When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(all comes down to you)
When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(all comes down to you)
All comes down to you
All comes down to you
All comes down to you"
Kodaline,All My Friends,"So it starts
We go back to your house
We check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Cause we know we're gonna be up late
And if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You turn the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
Then i still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, i know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

To tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sale force into the night

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
You're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of france
Yeah, i know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends, where are your friends tonight?

If you could see all your friends tonight
If you could see all your friends tonight
You know you'd be with your friends for life
If you could see all your friends tonight"
Kodaline,Better,"Am I wasting my time?
Am I losing my mind for better or for worse?
Cause it doesn't feel right
No it doesn't feel right

Does it make you feel better?
Cause it's making me worse
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it's making me hurt
Does it make you feel good?
When I'm falling apart?
Does it make you feel good?

And is it all in my head
Or was it something I said?
Somewhere in between
Cause I've got my regrets
And Im feeling like death
You don't see what I see

Does it make you feel better?
Cause it's making me worse
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it's making me hurt
Does it make you feel good?
When I'm falling apart?
Does it make you feel good? [x2]"
Kodaline,Big Bald World,"Maybe I'm wrong
Or maybe I'm right
Maybe it's just too late
but this is keeping me awake all night
Maybe say yes or maybe say no
Maybe I'm just too shy to admit
that it is time to go

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying' our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile

Maybe believe
Or maybe don't care
Shit, maybe there is no god
in the big white clouds up there
Maybe live long
Or maybe die young
Or maybe live every day
like it's your last day under the sun

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile [x2]

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Try to make it all feel right

Ohh…

We go out on our own
It's a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile [x2]

Ohh…"
Kodaline,Born Again,"Here I go again
Reaching for the light
I fall back down to earth
Every single time
I found my oxygen, brings me back to life
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me want to be better
Taking me back to the line
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
How darkness could turn into light
I know they say never say never
But I'll never, ever

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

One day, we'll be gone
We only get one life
We'll be the things we've done
And what we've left behind
The strength to carry on
In the back of my mind
It always looks like you
Looks like you

You make me want to be better
Taking me back to the line
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
How darkness could turn into light
I know the say never say never
But I'll never, ever

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

Born again, born again
Born again, born again

I found my oxygen
To bring me back to life
It always looks like you

I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
Born again, born again
And I'll keep believing
'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
Born again, born again

Born again, born again
Born again, born again"
Kodaline,Brand New Day,"This here hometown
I think I've outgrown
I wanna travel the world but I
I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come
To wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places
We could be

I've been flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting
Waiting on a brand new day

Riding on waves
Walking on sand
Digging in case to find the treasures of the land
And if we find gold
Well, we'll just throw it away
We can write stories bout the journeys that we made
We could be beating today

I've been flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting
Waiting on a brand new day
Waiting on a brand new

They said they'll keep me here
But I couldn't go another year
I said I'll see you soon
Because I whistle to a different tune

Think of all the places we could be
Think of all the people we could meet

I've been flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting
Waiting on a brand new day"
Kodaline,Caught In The Middle,"Can you see me below the clouds?
Cause I really feel like I could use you now
Watching over from up above
I can feel you in my heart and in my blood
Where did you go? Where have you gone?
When it's all over do we go on?
I make believe you're still around
It's like we're floating high above the clouds

I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
Before you know

Disappointments can wear you down
But life goes on and the world keeps spinning around
So be good and appreciate
The life you live is a life you can't replace

I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
Before you know

Any other second I try to make it better
Try to never leave me alone
I wanna see you now
While I'm breathing I'm wide awake and dreaming
And now you're starting to show
I really want you to know

I'm just caught, I'm just caught
I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
I really want you to know"
Kodaline,Coming Alive,"You're the clearest sky in the darkest weather
There was a big rain cloud hanging over me
You came along like a lightning bolt from heaven
Then you stole my heart and you set me free

You can't hide the feeling
Yeah you make it right
I'm coming alive

From the morning sun to the midnight hour
From the break of day to the dark of night
You're in my head and my heart and it feels much better
Yeah it feels so good and it feels so right

You can't hide the feeling
Through the days and the nights
Then I might be dreaming
We've got time on our side

(I'm coming alive)

In the clearest sky and the darkest weather
There was a big black cloud hanging over me
You came along like a lightning bolt from heaven
Then you stole my heart and you set me free

You can't hide the feeling
It feels so right
(I'm coming alive)"
Kodaline,Everything Works Out In The End,"I never seen it coming
I couldn't read the signs
But I know that it means nothing
Cause you are always on my mind
I got tricked into believing
You were the only one for me
But the heart can be deceiving
And I was just too young to see

They told me
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end

You got me treading on the water
Because I've never learned to swim
And now that it's all over
I better learn to start again

They told me
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end

Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end"
Kodaline,Gabriel,"He was an archangel of love
He had good news
For those dedicating their lives
To the spirit
One love was the focus of
The true message
Everybody felt the tension
Time was fading

Gabriel playin', gabriel
Gabriel
Dancin soon became the way
To, to communicate
Those who stood aside and watched
Gabriel playin'

Gabriel playin', gabriel
Gabriel
Gabriel playin'
Gabriel
Gabriel playin'
Archangel of love
The message
Gabriel

He had good news
Gabriel
Gabriel playin', gabriel"

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

Ever had a feeling that you can't go own
Trying to be strong, but getting weaker
Carrying the weight of every single day
Have you lost your way, feeling like defeated

Sat, staring, countings firewall
Patterns on the wall
You weren't run if you look
Cause their ever gonna turn around and all

Even they got the light got away
We're on the sunshine again
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Even if a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Your bedroom carpet stained with rosé wine
And this left behind, the morning after
The distant [?] cars, I'm soaking roads
And the streets and coast, been noise of laughter

Look bottom of the bottle
Find you almost every night
You're wonder If your light is ever gone
And turn the light away

Even they got the light got away
We're on the sunshine again
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Even if a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Confused and bothered by the motions of the changing tides
Your In the empty and you fella got the will to fight
You're on the riff
You gonna live or if you will survive, ooh

Even they got the light got away
We're on the sunshine again
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Even if a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep you head held high
You got to keep you head held high

Kodaline,Honest,"We don't communicate
Can you not say what's on your mind
And I see that every day
You hide the truth behind your eyes
Honestly, there's no need for you to hide
Talk to me, can't you see, I'm on your side

Honest, honest
Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I will be the one that walks away
Is it in you to be honest? Honest
Is it in you to be honest?

I still remember the day we met
I was hanging on your every word
I didn't think I would ever let somebody see into my world
Honestly, can't you see, I'm on your side

Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I will be the one that's walking away
Is it in you to be honest? Honest
Is it in you to be honest?

Is it all in my head or was it something I said
Because I'm trying to forgive, and now I'm trying to forget
You're telling me all of this and then I'm hearing that I did
It was all just a lie, was it all just a lie?
Now I'm walking away cos everything that you said
All that you ever tell to me is lies, lies

Honest, honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I will be the one that walks away
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Is it in you to be honest?"
Kodaline,Human Again,"I don't even recognize when I look into your eyes
All I can ever see,
is trouble hanging over me
Trouble, trouble, trouble hanging over me
Trouble, trouble, trouble is all I ever see

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest
I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head, and I'm losing my breath
I wanna be human again
Human Again, Human Again,
Human Again, Human Again
I wanna be human again

I can feel it in my bones,
I don't wanna die alone
When I all ever get is rain,
help me see the sun again
I can see the change in me,
makes me feel alive again.

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest
I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head, and I'm losing my breath
I wanna be human again
Human Again, Human Again
Human Again, Human Again
I wanna be human again

Look, I am finally lucky I'm trying to find
and I know there's a light in the dark
Open your eyes to the beauty
and settle your body, your soul and your heart

I wanna feel human, I wanna be human
Human again, what a beautiful feeling
Human again, I'm coming alive
Human again, I wanna be human,
I wanna be human again

I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest
I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head, and I'm losing my breath
I wanna be human again"
Kodaline,I Wouldn't Be,"I wouldn't be who I am, without you
I wouldn't sing the way I sing, without you
You fill my eyes up with color
And you'll always be my mother
I wouldn't be who I am

I wouldn't be the son that I am
Without a father who showed me I can
face all the bullies at school
You taught me how to keep my cool
I wouldn't be who I am

I wouldn't be the brother I am
Without a sister who understands
my ambitions and dreams
We always were on the same team
I wouldn't be who I am

Without the people
We don't see no more
And all the imperfections on my skin
The family tree, with its branches around me
Oh, I just wouldn't be who I am
I wouldn't be who I am

Ohh

I wouldn't be who I am

Ohh

I wouldn't be who I am

I wouldn't be the human I am
Without the friends that let me fly and help me land
Our foundations go deep
I'll always have a place to sleep
I wouldn't be who I am"
Kodaline,In the End,"I was blinded by the power
Climbing up the ladder
Even pushed away my father
I was caught up in the rat race
Living in a dark place
Man, I wish I never bothered

In the end, when all is said and done
In the end, we learn to overcome
In the end, we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget, and move on

I was standing there in silence
In a church somewhere in Ireland
It was there I was reminded
In the stakes that I corrected
And the people I affected
And the one's that I respected

In the end, when all is said and done
In the end, we learn to overcome
In the end, we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget, and move on
And move on, and move on
We forgive, we forget, and move on"
Kodaline,Latch,"You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there, there are boundaries
I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe
Now I know what I have found
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love, your love

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I feel so encaptured
Got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored
Hold me tight within your clutch
How did you do it?
You got me losing all my breath
How did you give me
To have my heartbeat out my chest?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go to you
Got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
I'm latching onto you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
You got me shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you"
Kodaline,Lose Your Mind,"Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side.
A hundred thousand butterflies
Floating in the orange skies above my head.
I wander lonely as a cloud
Floating high above the ground with aeroplanes.
I hear the sound of hummingbirds
The sweetest sound I've ever heard, I can't describe.

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do

Feeling like a plastic bag
Spinning 'round but slowly going nowhere fast.
Waterfalls inside my eyes
Am I on the other side, am I dreaming?
Holding on to a dolphin's fin
He helps me swim where I can't swim, he's friendly.
Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side.

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do

Walking on a tightrope wire
Dropping poison pills of fire... hynoptised
Euphoria will be here soon
Turn the lights down, let the answers fill the room

Oh oh, I'm dreaming up a world with you
Oh oh, and all the things that we could do

A hundred thousand butterflies
Floating in the orange skies above my head.
Loosen up and lose your mind
You never know what you could find on the other side.

All of the things that made you feel better
You should write it all down and put it in a letter.
[x2]"
Kodaline,Midnight,"Midnight, I've got trouble sleeping
I'm making my way up
to the street where we last kissed
In one hand, I hold a picture of you
In the other I hold the pieces of my heart
In the other I hold the pieces of my heart

Was my love not enough?
Did I ask too much?
As my heart turns to rust
Over you

And so long, I have trouble sleeping
I can help but feeling
A little insecure
So unsure

Was my love not enough?
Did I ask too much?
As my heart turns to rust
Over you"
Kodaline,One Day,"One day it's here and then it's gone
How are you still holding on
How are you still holding on

You felt this way for far too long
Waiting for a change to come
You know you're not the only one

And life passes you by
Don't be wasting your time
On your own

You always try to see yourself
Through the eyes of someone else
Through the eyes of someone else

Too shy to say that you need help
You and everybody else
You and everybody else

Life passes you by
Don't be waste your time
On your own

As your heart gets bigger
And you try to figure out
What's it all about

And your skin gets thicker
As you try to figure out
What's it all about

One day its here and then its gone
How are you still holding on
How are you still holding on"
Kodaline,Play The Game,"Oh my world is turning inside out
Say I'm crying breaking up inside
See my heart is sinking to my knees
Tell me brother what is it you need?

I don't wana be a pretender
I just wanna be me

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game

Oh you're blaming everybody else
Stop complaining and do it for yourself
Feed your body, your spirit and your mind
Oh my brother just enjoy the ride

I will never be a pretender
I'm just gonna be me

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game

Everybody's got a story to tell
When you're looking up at heaven
but you're stuck in hell, come on
You gotta play, play the game

Play the game

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Play the game
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Play the game
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game"
Kodaline,Pray,"How many nights do you lie dreaming
I'm counting the days since you went away
When I lost my heart, life lost all meaning
What I would give to see you again

I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?
I'll pray for you

And you slipped away from me without talking
The look in your eye was stronger than this
And I drink alone to stop me from weeping
What's left of my heart is forever yours
Forever yours

I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?
I'll pray for you

I know I know I know I know"
Kodaline,Ready,"You tell me that you're ready, but you just don't know
My eyes are getting heavy and it's starting to show
Never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through it if it's coming to me

Cause I've been so unlucky, I don't know what to say
Running out of money I've been wasting away
I'd never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through it if it's coming to me
We fall (we fall down) . If we fall (we fall down)
If we fall down hard, I'll be ready to crawl

I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it all

Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you
It's easy to get nervous, I've been feeling it too
Yeah it's kind of crazy, yeah it's kind of dumb
Never let the pressure overpower the fun

And yeah, I'm sure your parents might be saying it to you
Follow what you love and you will love what you do
And never let the pressure tell you that you're not
Capable of being everything that you want!

We fall (we fall down) . If we fall (we fall down)
If we fall down hard, I'll be ready to crawl

I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it all

[instrumental break]

I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it all

Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you
It's easy to get nervous, I've been feeling it too
Yeah it's kind of crazy, yeah it's kind of dumb
Never let the pressure overpower the fun

I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it
I am ready, I am ready for it all"
Kodaline,Ready to Change,"Shots rang out, but there's no gun
Still you hurt on everyone
In the dips of you, the sparks are good
But you're not even trying, trying
You feel the knife in your gut
But you're so scared of what you want
You bite you lip, and hold your tongue
What are you hiding? hiding

We got tired of your charms
And tired of your false alarms
You're just a book that never turns its page

You can stand on the edge shouting out that you're ready to change
Ready to change
You can say what you want
You won't jump, you're not ready to change
Ready to change

Ohh

Happy times, there's been a few
A different me, a different you
Now you sell your soul for something new
But nobody's buying, buying

'Cause we got tired of your charms
And tired of your false alarms
You're just a book that never turns its page

You can stand on the edge shouting out that you're ready to change
ready to change
You can say what you want
You won't jump, you're not ready to change
Ready to change

Ohh

You can stand on the edge shouting out that you're ready to change
Ready to change
You can say what you want
You won't jump, you're not ready to change
Ready to change

Ohh

You can stand on the edge shouting out that you're ready to change
Ready to change
You can say what you want
You won't jump, you're not ready to change
Ready to change

Ohh"
Kodaline,Saving Grace,"When you're out in the open
And you're tired of hopin'
I'll be there in a moment
I'll be by your side
When you're scared and you're lonely
When there's no one to hold you
I just want you to know that
I'll be by your side

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees
And your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace

When my heart's getting older
And my body is breakin' down
In my head yeah I know that I'll be by your side
I don't know about the future
No one knows what the future holds
All I know is I know that I'm giving you my life

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees
And your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you
Be my saving grace

You keep me strong when I can't carry on
Oh

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees
And your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace

Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace"
Kodaline,Shed a Tear,"It's harder to see through the eyes of a stranger
It's easier to love when the world doesn't hate you
When you try to sing out but nobody hears a word
It's safer to swim when the tide's not against you

Yeah-yeah (You've been here before)
I know you've been here before (Never letting go)
And giving up is letting go (Never fight alone)
But you don't have to fight alone

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leaving you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
That I shed a, I shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear
Shed a tear, shed a tear)

And I feel your pain when I know you're in trouble
And I'll take the blame from your hurt in your struggle
And when you tryna speak out but nobody hears a word
I'll be your voice, lay your head on my shoulder

Oh (You've been here before)
I know you've been here before (Never letting go)
And nothing is impossible (Never fight alone)
You don't have to fight alone

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

That I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll hed a tear (shed a tear)

And when you're livin' in your darkest hour
And when you're gettin' closer to the ash

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear

I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)

I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear (shed a tear)
I'll shed a, I'll hed a tear (shed a tear)"
Kodaline,Sometimes,"I'm not looking for an answer
I just hope that these words
will help whoever's listening
If someone cares to listen in
I've been up and down in life sure
Everyday is a chance to fight forever wrestling
Trying to make amends again

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we'll all get lost sometimes
Sometimes
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)

And every night when I'm alone
I put another podcast on
It helps me sleep away
Keeps me learning everyday
Reading books on meditation
Fights away the hesitation
Hanging over me
Easing the anxiety

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go

Don't understand

Going out of our minds
Maybe we'll all get lost sometimes

Kodaline,The Answer,"Watch your step or you might fall
You act like you're a know-it-all
Yeah I used to do that, I used to be like that
I'm still a bit like that

You might think you found the one
Until your heart gets ripped and torn
Yeah I used to feel bad, I used to feel like that
I still feel a bit like that

But I'm not searching for the answer
I'm not looking for the truth
I'm just talking through a speaker
Because that's all that I have ever learned to do

Use your mind and make it talk
Cause in this world it's all you've got
We all fall down from the highest clouds to the lowest ground

The loneliness is worst of all
When you've got no one else to call
Feeling kind of sad when the times are bad, the times are getting bad

But I'm not searching for the answer
No, I'm not looking for the truth
I'm just talking through a speaker
Because that's all that I could ever learn to do
Because that's all that I have ever learned to do

What about you?

So watch your step or you might fall
You act like you're a know-it-all
Yeah I used to do that, I used to be like that
I'm still a bit like that"
Kodaline,The Evening,"You lifted ourselves up
When with the wind
Tonight I miss you
It's hard to begin
We'd hide in my attic
And paint on the walls
I'll never forget that
I'll remember it all

I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
To see what I'm seeing
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking down water when the seas get rough
I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
Just for the evening

We go to a party
We poison our blood
Stay out after dark, we
Get lost in the woods
Last night I was sleeping
And I had a dream
That you were still breathing
And living like now

I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
To see what I'm seeing
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking down water when the seas get rough
I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here (Wish you could be here)
Just for the evening (Just for the evening)
I wish you could be here (Wish you could be here)
To see what I'm seeing (See what I'm seeing)
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking down water when the seas get rough
I wish you could be here (Wish you could be here)
Just for the evening (Just for the evening)
Just for the evening

Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
I wish you could be here"
Kodaline,This Must Be Christmas,"Ooh

It was cold in the night
On a long and dark December
And I'm drinkin' in the local bar alone
There's a man singin' out
Singin' words I can't remember
Something ‘bout a tale of old New York

Pour another whiskey for the road
‘Cause that's the only spirit that I know

Singin' oh, this must be Christmas
‘Cause I'm sick of the songs that the radio plays
But I'm drinkin' and singin' along anyways
Singin' oh, this must be Christmas
‘Cause there's only so much that my body can take
But I'm drinkin' and singin' along anyways
Singin' oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
MM

Had a fight with some guy
‘Cause he said I kissed his sister
Might have done, I guess we'll never know

So pour another whiskey for the road
‘Cause that's the only spirit that I know

Singin' oh, this must be Christmas
‘Cause I'm sick of the songs that the radio plays
But I'm drinkin' and singin' along anyways
Singin' oh, this must be Christmas
‘Cause there's only so much that my body can take
But I'm drinkin' and singin' along anyways
Singin' oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
MM
Singin' oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

So pour another whiskey for the road
‘Cause that's the only spirit that I know

Kodaline,Unclear,"I'm trying to learn and I'm dying to know
When to move on and when to let it go
A curious feeling no one can explain
And I just don't know if I'll risk it again

When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

So you swallow your heart and you swallow your pride
You gotta be tough if you wanna survive
They'll chew you up and they'll eat you alive
You shouldn't give up on the dreams in your mind

When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear

(We walk, we walk on
Our time, our time will come
We walk, we walk on
Our time)

(When the future's so unsure)
When the future's so unsure
(When the future's so unclear)
When the future's so unclear
(When the future's so unsure)
Oh, Oh
(When the future's so unclear)
Oh, Oh"
Kodaline,Way Back When,"We never had that much to do
So we just lay around in someone's house
Someday I'll have it all again
Just like way back when

Back then we'd sleep until the afternoon
And we'd just get up and go outside
Open a window, let the breeze blow in
Forget everything

Yea, those will be the days that I will be missing
When I'm older, when I'm gray and when I'll stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
We were just having fun

Well we'd go drinking in the afternoon
Lie out on the grass, so fall asleep
Oh will I ever see that girl again?
The girl from way back when

Yea, we used to share a cigarette
And throw together everything we had
And then you're driving in my parents' car
And loving straight til you fall

Yea, those will be the days that I will be missing
When I'm older, when I'm gray and when I'll stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun

Those will be the days that won my soul

Yea, in time we moved so fast
Some things are made to last
I'm here to see you, my dear old friend
From way back when

Yea, those will be the days that I will be missing
When I'm older, when I'm gray and when I'll stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun"
Kodaline,Worth It,"The stars in the pavement
Washed up and jaded
There is blood on the streets of gold
Beautiful waitress just go and make it
So far away from home

Are you strong enough?
Oh, are you wise enough?
Are you giving up?
Will you dissapear?
When it comes to me
And I want you to say
I wanna live, but I can't stay

I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

No one can see them
The angels and demons
Attesting how long you go
Sunset, some sunset
As dark as you heart gets
Is best if you just say no

But are you strong enough
Oh, are you wise enough?
Are you giving up?
Will you dissapear?
When it comes to me
And I want you to say
I wanna live, but I can't stay

I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know

Is it worth it? I don't know

I don't know, if I want it or if I don't
I don't know
I don't know if it's worth it or if it's not

I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know
I don't know if it's worth it
Is it worth it? I don't know

Adele,Someone Like You,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me
It isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
""Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead""

Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
""Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead""

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bitter-sweet
This would taste?

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said:
""Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead""

Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead, yeah"
Adele,Easy On Me,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in the silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for a thing to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I've changed who I was to put you both first
But now, I givе up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get thе chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know it now
It probably hasn't even shown

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me"
Adele,Rolling In The Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind
And reap just what you sow
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all it all,

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it,you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"
Adele,Set Fire To The Rain,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark and I was over,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,

When I lay with you I could stay there,
Close my eyes,
Feel you here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better,

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, It felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
Even now when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for ya,

I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touch your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, I felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh,
Oh, no,
Let it burn, oh,
Let it burn,
Let it burn."
Adele,Hello,"Hello
It's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger
And free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference
Between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope
That you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Oohh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore"
Adele,I Drink Wine,"How can one become so bounded
By choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version
Of a person we don't even like?

We're in love with the world
But the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads
That corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child
Every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun
But now I only soak up wine

They say to play hard, you work hard
Find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody
Who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (Trying, trying)
To keep climbing (Climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something
You just want me

Why am I obsessing
About the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval
From people I don't even know?

In these crazy times
I hope to find something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you (I've cried, I've cried)
I've cried high tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad
But you can't fight fire with fire (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants something from me
You just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all
'Cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find (We'll both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less travelled
Is a road best left behind (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants something from me
You just want me

You better believe I'm trying (Trying, trying)
To keep climbing (Climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
I won't have without you
Like it's just like a very heavy thing to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go and to make new memories with him
There was just memories in the big storm"
Adele,Love In The Dark,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay


I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me"
Adele,Oh My God,"I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life
And into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell
Is a battle I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life
And into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell
Is a battle I cannot fight

Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down

Adele,Send My Love (To Your New Lover),"Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting, you and me
Mm, that was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mm, baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up
You were falling down (down)
Mm, there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts

Adele,When We Were Young,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"
Adele,To Be Loved,"I built a house for love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

I'm so afraid but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Trying to learn to lean in to it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe 'til the time feels right

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried"
Adele,Strangers By Nature,"I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers, in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood a chance as if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

I've never seen the sky this colour before
It's like I'm noticing everything a little bit more
Now that all the dust has settled
I rebut all my rebuttals
No one knows what it's like to be us

Strangers by nature
Strangers by nature

Will I ever get there?
Oh, I hope that someday I'll learn
To nurture what I've done

Uh, huh, hm
Uh, huh, hm, hm, hm
Uh, huh, hm, hm, hm
Hm, hm, hm, hm
Alright then, I'm ready"
Adele,My Little Love,"Hmm, hmm

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here since he did
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million by fact

I don't recognize myself in the coldness of the day light
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Do you like-like me?
You know mommy doesn't like
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (Baby)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just like, mummy, I'm, I'm, the feeling
That I have, like, hm, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all

My little love
Tell me do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me
Can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

I love your dad because he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holding on (Baby)
Mama's gotta lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holding on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

Hmm, hmm

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
Being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home, and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up into a ball
And be in my sweats and stuff like that
I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this at all"
Adele,Woman Like Me,"You're driving me away
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you
But not in this way

I don't think you quite understand
Who you have on your hands
How can you not see
Just how good for you I am?

I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in
'Cause I only want to be the cure

If you don't choose to grow
We ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

All you do is complain
About decisions you make
How can I help lift you
If you refuse to activate
The life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place
But you will never give it up

It's where they make you feel powerful
That's why you think I make you feel small
But that's your projection
It's not my rejection

I put my heart on the line
For the very first time
Because you asked me to
And now you've gone and changed your mind

But loving you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get
The love I have for you
'Cause you don't care
Uh hmm

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

A woman like me
(One more time)

Complacency (Woman like me)
Is the worst trait to have (Woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't ever had
Ain't ever had a woman like me (Woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (Woman like me)
Consistency (Woman like me) is the gift to give for free
And it is key"
Adele,Hold On,"Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold onto who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win

Hold on
Let time be patient
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now I truly hate being me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

Just hold on (Just hold on)
Let time be patient (You)
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious (Love will soon come)
Just hold on (You, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Hold on (You, just hold on, just hold on)

Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get
(Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness actually let's us forget
(Just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret
(Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

So just hold on (Just hold on)
Let time be patient (You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come, baby
If you just hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (Hold on)
Just let time be patient
'Cause you're still strong
You're still strong (You are still strong)
Just be gracious
'Cause love will soon come
If you just hold on
(You, just hold on, you, just just hold on, you, just hold on)
Just be patient, just be patient
(You, just hold on, you, just just hold on
You, just hold on, you, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)"
Adele,Skyfall,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall"
Adele,Love Is a Game,"All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely you know, that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see, ee-ee, ee-ee

To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind

When I walk in a room I'm invisible
I feel like a ghost (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
All my friends keep on telling me
That this feeling won't last (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I have nothing to feel no more
I can't even cry (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I wake up I'm afraid at the idea of facing the day
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away
Please stop calling me, it's exhausting
There's really nothing left to say
I created this storm
It's only fair I have to sit in its rain

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

All love is devout
No feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now
Before it's too late
In the end it's just you
Stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace"
Adele,Can I Get It?,"Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road

Throw me to the water (Water, water)
I don't care how deep or shallow (Water)
Because my heart can pound like thunder (Water)
And your love, and your love can set me free

I have promised I will love you till the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine

So can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

You tease me with your control

And without your love I'm hollow
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own

I have promised I will love you
Till the end of time (End of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad
The ugly, and divine (The divine)

Adele,One and Only,"You've been on my mind,
I grow fonder every day,
Lose myself in time,

doubts go,

To forgive your past and simply be mine,

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only,
Promise I'm worthy,
To hold in your arms,
So come on and give me a chance,
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile,
Until the end starts,

If I've been on your mind,
You hang on every word I say,
Lose yourself in time,
At the mention of my name,
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close,
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go?

I don't know why I'm scared,
'Cause I've been here before,
Every feeling, every word,
I've imagined it all,
You'll never know if you never try,
To forgive your past and simply be mine,
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only,
I promise I'm worthy, mmm,
To hold in your arms,
So come on and give me a chance,
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile,
Until the end starts,

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart,
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart,
Nobody's perfect,
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart),
Trust me I've learned it,
Nobody's perfect,
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart),
Trust me I've learned it,
Nobody's perfect,
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart),
Trust me I've learned it,
Nobody's perfect,
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart),
Trust me I've learned it,

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only,
I promise I'm worthy,
To hold in your arms,
So come on and give me a chance,
To prove I am the one who can, maybe,
walk that mile,
Until the end starts,

Come on and give me a chance,
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile,
Until the end starts."
Adele,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you
Haven't made
Your mind up yet
But I would never
Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change
Are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing
Like me yet

I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love"
Adele,Don't You Remember,"When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
I hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?"
Adele,All I Ask,"I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow, oh
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that's mattered,
tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want it to be cruel or unjust
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just your friend
Give me a memory that I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?"
Adele,Turning Tables,"Close enough to start a war,
All that I have is on the floor,
God only knows what we're fighting for,
All that I say, you always say more,

I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,

Under hardest disguise I see, ooh,
Where love is lost, your ghost is found,
I braved a hundred storms to leave you,
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down,

I can't keep up with your turning tables,
Under your thumb, I can't breathe,

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I cant give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
Turning tables,

Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
When the thunder calls for me,
Next time I'll be braver,
I'll be my own savior,
Standing on my own two feet,

I won't let you close enough to hurt me,
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me,
I can't give you what you think you gave me,
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables,
To turning tables,
Turning tables, yeah,
Turning, oh."
Adele,All Night Parking (with Erroll Garner),"I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just want to spend all my time with you (Feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress
Don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party
I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (Like, oh my God)
It's so hard to digest
Usually I'm best alone
But every time that you text
I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long

Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And then some)
The sight of you is dramatic
One glimpse and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours
'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you
All night long

All night long
All night"
Adele,(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But your love was the key to peace my mind

You make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman, yeah

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm looking for
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman

Oh, baby, look you've done to me
makes me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me feel so alive

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman."
Adele,Baby It's You,"Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

Oh
Many
Many
Many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself 'cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
(Sha la la la la)
You should hear what they say about you
(Cheat)
(Cheat)
(Sha la la la la)
They say you never
Never
Never ever been true
(Cheat)
(Cheat)

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do when it's true
Don't want nobody
Nobody 'cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Yeah

Oh
Oh
Many
Many
Many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself 'cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you"
Adele,Best For Last,"Wait, do you see
My heart on my sleeve?
It's been there
For days on end and
It's been waiting for you
To open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

This made you fell the way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel the way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I will do unitl i
Find myself with you

And make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And be all you need
So that you never want more
Then we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you"
Adele,Black and Gold,"The fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking

And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

I looked up into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold"
Adele,Can't Be Together,"You've got your eye on me after all these years
You think that I can't see you from over here
I may be out of your view but I can hear you
I may be out of the room but I can see you
I know you still want me, you always will
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I would still do anything for you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

I was far too reckless, I know that now
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out
But know that I live with my doubt

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I want to do everything with you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

Since we were together everybody's changed
Our reflections in the mirror no longer look the same
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make
But I will always miss you at the end of each day

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

But we can't be together
No, we won't be together"
Adele,Can't Let Go,"When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know I can't let go

Ooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Ooh I thought I died in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Hope you know, I won't let go"
Adele,Chasing Pavements,"I've made up my mind,
Don't need to think it over,
If I'm wrong I am right,
Don't need to look no further,
This ain't lust,
I know, this is love but,

If I tell the world,
I'll never say enough,
Cause it was not said to you,
And that's exactly what I need to do,
If I'm in love with you,

Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I'd build myself up,
And fly around in circles,
Wait then as my heart drops,
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it, or

Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere"
Adele,Cold Shoulder,"You say it's all in my head
And the things I think
Just don't make sense
So where you been then?
Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me
Like it's my fault
See I can see
That look in your eyes
The one that shoots me
Each and every time

Chorus:
You grace me
With your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me
I wish I was her
You shower me with words
Made of knives
Whenever you look at me
I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look
Like see-through
Do tell me why
You waste our time
When your heart
Ain't admitting
You're not satisfied
You know I know
Just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself
Feeling that way too

(Chorus)

Time and time again
I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight
When you
(I see you)
Try to look for things
I hear
But our eyes never find
'Though I do know how you play

(Chorus 2x)"
Adele,Crazy For You,"Found myself today
Singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am
I'm crazy for you

Sometimes
Sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you
Who makes me
Lose my head

And every time
I'm meant to be
Acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me
Into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run
And I'll race
If you want me
To stop I'll freeze
And if you are me
Gonna leave
Just hold me
Closer, baby
And make me
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state
I'm in I can't help
Myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning
Closer to you

My oh, my
How my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me
Into my favourite mood

I keep on trying
Fighting
These feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors
And opening doors
Hoping
You'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too
Crazy for you
Crazy for you"
Adele,Daydreamer,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back

You can find him
Sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
And he will feel like
He's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then see's you through

There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him
Sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like
He's been there for hours
And I can tell he'll be there for life
And I can tell he'll be there for life"
Adele,Dreaming Of You,"What's up with my heart when it skips a beat
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet
Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now

What's up with my heart when it skips a beat
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet
Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now

When I'm down and my hands are tied
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line
From this pain I just can't disguise
It's gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye
Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now

Oh yeah

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now"
Adele,Easy on Me (With Chris Stapleton),"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me"
Adele,Fastlove,"Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just see that maybe
You can help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if your looking for... Fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love it's all that I've got in my mind
Oh oh, oh oh

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just see that maybe
You can help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if your looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love it's all that I've got on my mind
Oh oh, baby baby
Oh oh, baby baby
Oh oh, baby baby
Oh oh

In the absense of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I, I, I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss by baby"
Adele,First Love,"So little to say
But so much time
Despite my empty mouth
The words are in my mind
Please wear the face
The one where you smile
Because you
Lighten up my heart
When I start to cry

Forgive me first love
But I'm tired
I need to get away
To feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close
To change my mind
Please wipe that look
Out of your eyes
It's bribing me
To doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up
And stayed behind
And if I stay
I'll be a lie
Then choke on words
I'd always hide
Excuse me first love
But we're through
I need to taste the kiss
From someone new

Forgive me first love
But I'm too tired
I'm bored to say
The least and I
I lack desire
Forgive me first love
Forgive me first love
Forgive me first love
Forgive me first love
Forgive me
Forgive me first love
Forgive me first love"
Adele,Fool That I Am,"Fool that I am,
For falling in love with you.
And a, fool that I am,
For thinking you loved me, too.

You took my heart,
Then played the part of little coquette.
And, all my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette.

Fool that I am,
For hoping you'd understand.
And thinking you would listen, too,
And, oh, the things I had planned.

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye.
But I still care, but I still care,
And oh, fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care,
Fool that I am."
Adele,He Won't Go,"Some say I'll be better without you,
But they don't know you like I do,
Or at least the sides I thought I knew,
I can't bear this time,
It drags on as I lose my mind,
Reminded by things I find,
Like notes and clothes you've left behind,
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done,
I won't rise until this battle's won,
My dignity's become undone,

But I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride,
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined,
I won't forgive me if I give up trying,
I heard his voice today,
I didn't know a single word he said,
Not one resemblance to the man I met,
Just a vacant broken boy instead,

But I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk,

There will be times, we'll try and give it up,
Bursting at the seams, no doubt,
We'll almost fall apart, then burn to pieces,
So watch them turn to dust,
But nothing will ever taint us,

I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk,

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place
Where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday,
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait,
I'll be home so soon, I won't be late,

He won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk,
So I won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk,

'Cause he won't go,
He can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk,
I won't go,
I can't do it on my own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk."
Adele,Hello (Bradley Allan Remix),"Hello
It's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over
Everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello
Can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger
And free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference
Between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello
How are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope
That you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore"

Adele,Hiding My Heart,"This is how the story went
I met someone by accident,
That blew me away
That blew me away

It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave
watched you wave
Then I went home to my skyscrapers,
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call it home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain
The morning rain
And though I wish that you were near
That same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I can('t) spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
Adele,Hometown Glory,"I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet

""Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there
anyone I could call?""

""No and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just
wandering""

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of this world

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque

I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades

I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of this world"
Adele,I Can't Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head

Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me closely
Don't patronize

Don't patronize me

'Cuz I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't

I close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me

Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight

And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I'll feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't"
Adele,I Found a Boy,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true!
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer,
closer in here,
Like a fool for fire I fall,
With my pride and all!
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call?
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

(Chorus:)
But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you calling back to me
To whisper will you leave your man??
Cause you sweared that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you!

(Chorus:)
Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

(Chorus:)
Well I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me
Now that I don't need you!"
Adele,I Just Want to Make Love To You (with Jools Holland),"I don't want you

Adele,I Miss You,"I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I want to teach you things you never knew baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do baby
Bring your heart I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I want to step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living world's apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
Harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight don't let go
Baby give me light
Baby give me light
I miss you"
Adele,I'll Be Waiting,"Hold me closer one more time,
Say that you love me in your last goodbye,
Please forgive me for my sins,
Yes, I swam dirty waters,
But you pushed me in,
I've seen your face under every sky,
Over every border and on every line,
You know my heart more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

But we had time against us,
And miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless,
I'll be waiting,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you."
Adele,If It Hadn't Been For Love,"Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian'
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda took a mind to track her down
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
Put myself behind a jail house door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian'
If it hadn't been for love
Never woulda loaded up a forty four
Put myself behind a jail house door

If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love"
Adele,Last Night,"Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door

Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out

Cuz I left that night
Yeah

They don't understand
No, girlfriends

In spaceships
They won't understand
And me

Gonna understand

Adele,Lay Me Down,"I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)

No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me

Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)

Adele,Many Shades Of Black,"Go ahead
Go ahead
And smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left
And take it with you out the door

See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
I can't say
That it's been that great
No
In fact it's been a wasted year

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way too long

And shout and say things
That are so unkind

And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

Adele,Melt My Heart To Stone,"Right under my feet
There's air
Made of bricks
Pulls me down
Turns me weak
For you
I find myself
Repeating like
A broken tune
And I'm forever
Excusing
Your intentions
And I give in
To my pretendings
Which forgive you
Each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart
To stone

And I hear your words
That I made up
You say my name
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time
I turn around to leave
I feel my heart
Begin to burst
And bleed
So desperately
I try to link it
With my head
But instead
I fall back
To my knees
As you tear your way
Right through me
I forgive you
Once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt
My heart to stone

And I hear your words
That I made up
You say my name
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you
Steal my hand
Whenever
I'm standing
My own ground
You build me up
Then leave me dead

Well

I hear your words
You made up
So I say your name
Like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love"
Adele,Million Years Ago,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly
Learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor

I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I had grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago"
Adele,My Same,"You said I'm stubborn
And I never give in
I think you're stubborn
'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish
I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out
In way too much in fact
I say we've only known
Each other one year

You say I've known
You longer my dear
You like to be so close
I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs
And you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never
Match at all
But we do
But we do
But we do
But we do

I thought I knew myself
Somehow you know me more
I've never known this
Never before
You're the first
To make out
Whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be
If I didn't know you
You're so provocative
I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous
I'm so very cautious
Combining
You think
We would and we do
But we do
But we do
But we do

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad
To make an exception

Adele,Need You Now,"Picture perfect memories,
Scattered all around the floor.
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.

Another shot of whisky,
can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweeping
in the way you did before.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm a little drunk,
And I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.

oh ohhh...

Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
And I said I wouldn't call
but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now,
I just need you now.
Oh, baby I need you now."
Adele,Never Gonna Leave You,"I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try?
There's something new
Inside my heart
And it cries like a child
Whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, the more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling so brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the death or glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting at the seams
No doubt that will almost fall apart
Then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other
Nothing is easy enough

So let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
I swear I'm never gonna leave you
'Cause you're the only one I want

You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no"
Adele,Now And Then,"Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know
They're enough to picture the rain

Cause hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me
I might
Just your heal (4x)"
Adele,Painting Pictures,"Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
[To add] some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind

[There is no simple for me]

I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
[With the world at your feet]
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
[To scratch my itch and beat my drum]
So I can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories [x2]

Running riot inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up

[To Scratch my itch and beat my drum]
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories"
Adele,Promise This,"In my beginning there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And you came in turned the lights on
And created what it's came to be
Before I pluck your wings, cover me, please
Spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this, if I die before I wake oh
Promise this, take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Déployer l'aile

Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Alouette uette uette
Plumerai l'aile

Though I'm walking through the shadows
You are with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now time for sleeping
But before that would you restore me
Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please, spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake oh
Promise this take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this be the last to kiss my lips

By a thread we're hanging on
In the hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me
No, I wanna go with you

Promise this if I die before I wake oh
Promise this take a time to say your grace
On your knees you pray for me
Promise this be the last to kiss my lips

Adele,Remedy,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
Ohh

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you, love you

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
Ohh, ohh

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy"
Adele,Reminded,"She said if you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go

[Tyga - verse 1]
The memories soon fade, why couldn't they be erased
You hoping it's just a phase, your heart'll heal within days
Some people think it's wrong, being single isn't right
But you hurt the right person you'll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I'm close to you, f-cking til' the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cooking with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I'm nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flying just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn't enough
Now it's gone but sometimes I sit and hope

[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[Tyga - verse 2]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust, I loved you and now I'm backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a f-cking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can't compromise, we all equal opportunists
It's when I'm level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I'm throwing bread off
Cold, women, fall in love getting splintered?
Strictly plutonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can't fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin

[Adele]
I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

[Tyga]
Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh
Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS
They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next
Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks
Go home
I ain't tryna do you wrong
I'd rather be alone
Just sittin on the throne"
Adele,Right As Rain,"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes
And your all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when your on top

Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble
Back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least
When your at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
as much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

Cause who wants
To be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even thought
Everything's a strain
When night comes
And I'm all on my own
You should know
I chose to be alone
So who want to be
Right as rain
It's harder
When your on top

Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love"
Adele,River Lea,"Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake

Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance

No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea"
Adele,Rumour Has It,"She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)
Rumour has it (rumour)

But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for"
Adele,Set Fire To The Rain (Thomas Gold Remix),"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark and I was over,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name,

But I set fire...

All the things you'd say
All the things you'd say"
Adele,Steady As She Goes,"Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town

Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)

So steady as she goes

Your friends have shown
A kink
In the single life
You've had too much to think
Now you need a wife

Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend
That knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though
You tripped and fell

So steady as she goes

When you have completed
What you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted
To the point of stable glue

Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend
That knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though
You tripped and fell

So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes

Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round)

Settle for a girl
(Settle for a girl)
Neither up or down
(Neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd
(Sell it to the crowd)
That is gathered round
(That is gathered round)

So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)

Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)

Steady as she go
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?

Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?

Steady as she goes"
Adele,Sweetest Devotion,"With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion"
Adele,Take It All,"Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best,
Gave you everything I had,
Everything and no less,
Didn't I do it right?
Did I let you down?

Maybe you got too used to,
Having me around,
Still, how can you walk away,
From all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road,
Without me right here,

But go on and take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love,

Maybe I should leave,
To help you see,
Nothing is better than this,
And this is everything we need,
So is it over?
Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily,
I thought you loved me more than this,

But go on, go on and take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love,

I will change if I must,
Slow it down and bring it home,
I will adjust,
Oh, if only,
If only you knew,
Everything I do is for you,

But go on, go on and take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it,
Take it all with you,
Don't look back,
At this crumbling fool,
Just take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love,
Take it all,
With my love."
Adele,That's It I Quit I'm Movin' On,"When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem o care
You close the door and leave me standing there

Oh, honey that's not fair
That's it, I quit, I'm movin' on

The other night we had a date
An you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses thrill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby I can take a lot cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on"
Adele,Tired,"Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes
Your were smiling
In the spotlight dancing
With the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing it ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

Chorus:
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I dont get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

(I should have known)

Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help
Believe the trick me
Back into them
Even though

(chorus)
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what
And for what
And for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired"
Adele,Water and a Flame,"[Daniel:]
Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
It's been nearly an hour
Since I thought of you

But you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least that I'd know that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away
Oh...

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame...

[Adele:]
I'm tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A cup more till I forget your name

I saw a boy that looked like you
I didn't know quite what to do
It took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasn't there

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame...

[Daniel:]
If you see me coming...

[Adele:]
I look away, I look away...

[Daniel:]
And if your mind is made up...

[Adele:]
I look away, I will look away...

[Daniel:]
If your worry bound

[Adele:]
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am

[Daniel:]
All this sorrow and this pain
is going to go away

[Daniel & Adele:]
Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame..."
Adele,Water Under The Bridge,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh and if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woaah, woaaah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"
Adele,When We Were Young (Rulezz Remix),"But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young"
Adele,Why do You Love Me,"Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I bleed
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and dark of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?"
Adele,Wild Wild West,"I grew a nipper in the wild wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild wild west
I was galivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow catching in the wilderness

Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

Now I'm cutting shines in the wild wild west
I had to bed my man down to save my self
That's when I, I got churched in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress

From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go"
Adele,You'll Never See Me Again,"In the darkness of my heart
Is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said

At the dawning of the day
I can't barely see the light, I
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

At the dawning of the day
I can't barely see the light, I
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the eaves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on

You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you, now
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now

You'll never see me again, I'll be better
In time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again"
Nancy Sinatra,Bang Bang,"I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play""

""Bang bang, I shot you down""
""Bang bang, you hit the ground""
""Bang bang, that awful sound""
""Bang bang, I used to shoot you down""

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Baby shot me down..."
Nancy Sinatra,These Boots Are Made For Walking,"you keep saying you've got something for me.
something you call love, but confess

one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.

are you ready boots? start walkin'!"
Nancy Sinatra,You Only Live Twice,"You Only Live Twice or so it seems,
One life for yourself and one for your dreams.
You drift through the years and life seems tame,
Till one dream appears and love is its name.

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.

This dream is for you, so pay the price.
Make one dream come true, you only live twice.

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.

This dream is for you, so pay the price.
Make one dream come true, you only live twice.

(from James Bond 007 - You Only Live Twice, 1967)"
Nancy Sinatra,Summer Wine,"Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you...summer wine
Oh..oh..oh...summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you...summer wine
Oh...summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with the unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me...more summer wine
Woh..woh..oh...summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you...summer wine
Mm...summer wine

When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me craving for...more summer wine
Oh..oh..summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs, help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Oh...oh...summer wine"

Nancy Sinatra,100 Years,"I'm not gonna say everything is okay
'Cause okay is not the way that I feel.
I'm not gonna be any fools' Christmas tree
Let'em hang gifts on me that aren't real

I'm not gonna take second best
I've got no use for the rest.
World you better hear what I say
'Cause for me true love could be
100 years away.

I'm not giving in to a smile or a grin

On a face huh I might never see again.
I'm not gonna fly in some big phoney sky
On a ride that I know just can't win.

And I'm not gonna take second best
No I've got no use for the rest.
So world you better hear what I say
Cause for me true love could be
100 years away.

And if it is, I'll wait."
Nancy Sinatra,Another Gay Sunshine Day,"Welcome to our swaree

Chickens will dance with bears
Wolves prance and walk on air
Reach out and take me there (come out and play)

Nancy Sinatra,As Tears Go By,"It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see but not for me
I sit and watch as tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
But all I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch as tears go by

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
Oh but where are you
I sit and watch as tears go by"
Nancy Sinatra,Burning Down The Spark,"Standin in the crowds
Lost out in the street
Loving the chaos
With my heart down at my feet

Taking every step like it's my (very) last
Looking round the corners
Searching through the glass
For a glimpse of you
Eyes of shining blue
All these memories of you come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

Taste the stinging rain
Falling on my tongue
Hanging on your words
Cherish every one
Can't bring you back no matter what I say
Driving in my car just to drive away
Hear the tires spin
Round and round again
All these memories still come to haunt me
They come to haunt me

The city sleepin' cross the river
I'm up alone burning down the spark
Well I wonder where you are tonight
And how far are you drifted out there, out there in the dark

Wind at my window
Rattling my doors
Pounding on my heart
Like it's never done before
Still I wonder if it could be these memories
No matter how I try (they) never let me be
Always find a way
Calling out your name
All these memories of you stay and haunt me
Mmh come to haunt me
Mmh they still haunt me
Oh they come and haunt me"
Nancy Sinatra,Call Me,"If you're feeling sad and lonely
There's a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender

Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around

When it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you

Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around

Now don't forget me
'Cause if you let me
I will always stay by you
You gotta trust me

There's so much that I can do

Call me, don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around

If you call I'll be right with you
You and I should be together

I'll be at your side forever

Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around"

Comes out tomorrow
Crying time will start
When you walk out the door

You hold me darling
That it wont be long

Nancy Sinatra,Elusive Dreams,"I followed you to Texas
I followed you to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

I followed you to Alabama
Things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

I had your child in Memphis
You heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no goldmine

But this time only two of us move on
And now, now we have each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams"

Nancy Sinatra,Let Me Kiss You,"There's a place in the sun, For anyone who has the will to chase one
And I think I've found mine, Yes, I do believe I have found mine, so

Close your eyes, And think of someone, You physically admire
And let me kiss you, Let me kiss you

I've zig-zagged all over America, And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry, On your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice

Close your eyes, And think of someone, You physically admire,
And let me kiss you, Let me kiss you

But then you open your eyes, And you see someone, That you physically despise
But my heart is open, my heart is open to you."

Nancy Sinatra,Lightning's Girl,"I've told you that I'm Lightning's girl
But you keep hanging 'round
If Lightning ever catches you
He's got to put you down
(spoken) About six feet!

Stay away from Lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from Lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down...yeah

Better stop your grooving 'round
Another rooster's hen
If Lightning ever catches you
He's got to do you in
In about two minutes!

Stay away from Lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from Lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down

Here comes Lightning down the street
While you just stand there talking
If I were you I'd start to move
And tell my story walking
(spoken) About a hundred miles an hour!

Stay away from Lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from Lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down

Stay away from Lightning's g-i-r-l
Stay away from Lightning's g-i-r-l
Stay away from Lightning's g-i-r-l
Stay away from Lightning's g-i-r-l"

Lee: We didn't find it there so we moved on

Nancy: I followed you to Alabam', things looked good in Birmingham
Lee: We didn't find it there so we moved on

BOTH: I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

Nancy: I had your child in Memphis, you heard of work in Nashville
Lee: We didn't find it there so we moved on

Lee: To a small farm in Nebraska, to a gold mine in Alaska
Nancy: We couldn't find it there so we moved on

Lee: And now we've left Alaska because there was no gold mine

Nancy: (SPOKEN) But this time, only two of us move on. And now now we have
each other. And a little memory to cling to.

Lee: And still you won't let me go on alone.

For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

Nancy Sinatra,Something Stupid,"I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two......
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before......
And though it's just a lie to you for me it's true......
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true......
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head......
The stars get red and oh the night's so blue......
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you"
Nancy Sinatra,Sorry 'bout That,"Last night I went trippin' out with someone new
Headin' straight to where I knew you'd be
So c'mon baby tell me what it did to you
When you saw that stranger kissin' me

You ain't gonna treat me
Like no alley cat
And if I broke your heart last night
Sorry 'bout that

You keep tellin' me that you don't care no more
Like you're the only joker in the deck
Well I'd just like to know what you were shakin' for
When he put his arms around my neck


And you ain't gonna treat me
Like no alley cat
And if I broke your heart last night
Gee, I'm sorry 'bout that

And you tell me my motor just ain't runnin' right
He tells me I'm pretty well equipped
So baby tell me why your face kept turnin' white
Every time I sent him on a trip

I'm tired of bein' treated, yeah
Like your alley cat
So if I broke your heart last night
You know how sorry I am about that

If there's anything I can't stand to see is a grown man cry. Poor baby."
Nancy Sinatra,Storybook Children,"You've got your world, & I've got mine, and it's a shame ...
Two grownup worlds that will never be the same ...

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow ...
Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
In a wonderland, where nothing's planned, for tomorrow.

You've got his ring, you've got his heart, you've got his baby ...
And it's too late to turn and start again! ...

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow ...
Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
In a wonderland, where nothing's planned, for tomorrow.

How happy we could be
If only we
Were storybook children
storybook children

Nancy Sinatra,Sugar Town,"I got some troubles but they won't last
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
And pretty soon all my troubles will pass
'cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town

I never had a dog that liked me some
Never had a friend or wanted one
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
'cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town

Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
I heard it also rained in Tallahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
'cause I was in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town

If I had a million dollars or ten
I'd give to ya, world, and then
You'd go away and let me spend
My life in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town

Nancy Sinatra,The City Never Sleeps At Night,"Old man, young man
Preacher saying amen
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city
It never sleeps at night

Red cars, blue cars
Payment overdue cars
Cops with indigestion
Billionaires and some bums
How come the city
It never sleeps at night
How come the city
It never sleeps at night

Short girls, tall girls
Happy that they're all girls
Walking with some nice man
Holding hands and then some
How come the city
It never sleeps at night

Good guys, bad guys
Millionaires and show guys
Losers with their hands out
Patients begging breadcrumb
How come the city
It never sleeps at night
The city
It never sleeps at night

Long night, short night
Big hellos and goodbyes
Dreams of conversation
Not a single ho-hum
How come the city
It never sleeps at night

Old man, young man
Preacher saying amen
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come the city
It never sleeps at night

It never sleeps at night"
Nancy Sinatra,The Last Of The Secret Agents,"He's never caught one spy untold
He's never even caught a cold
Got his degree from Disney Land
But he's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man

He's an underwhelming kind of sleuth
He thinks James Bond is some kind of suit
He's farther back than also ran
But he's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man

He'd come in third in a two-horse race
I've never had to slap his face
(What a shame)
But people try to understand
He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man

He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man"
Nancy Sinatra,The More I See You,"The more I see you,
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling
just grows and grows
With every sigh
I become more mad about you
More lost without you
and so it goes

Can you imagine
how much I love you?
The more I see you
as years go by
I know the only one for me
can only be you
My arms won't free you,
and my heart won't try"
Nancy Sinatra,The Shadow Of Your Smile,"The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love and see
All the lovely things
You are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
Nancy Sinatra,Things,"Things (featuring Dean Martin)



Every night I sit here by my window (window)
Staring at the lonely avenue (avenue)
Watching lovers holdin' hands
And laughin' (ha ha ha)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to)
And heartaches are the friends
I'm talkin' to (but you got me now)
When I'm not thinkin' of just how much
I love you ('bout I love you, too)
I'm thinkin' the things we used to do
(Used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do

I still can hear the juke box softly
Playin' (playin')
And the face I see each day belongs to you
(Belongs to you)
But there's not a single sound
And there's nobody else around
But that's just me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(We used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night that we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
You got me thinkin' 'bout
The things we used to do (I hope so)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do"
Nancy Sinatra,Time,"Some people run
Some people crawl
Some people don't even move at all

Some roads lead forward
Some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in white
Some wrapped in fearful black

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?

Some people never get
And some never give
Some people never die
But some never live

Some folks they treat me mean
Some treat me kind
But most folks just go their way
Don't pay me no mind

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?

Sometimes I'm satisfied
Sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold
Sometimes it's hot

At sunset I laugh
But at sunrise I cry
At midnight I'm in between
And wondering why

Time, oh time
Where did you go?
Time, oh good good time
Where did you go?"
Nancy Sinatra,"Two Shots Of Happy, One Shot Of Sad","Two Shots Of Happy, One Shot Of Sad

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad
Took you to a place, now you can't get back
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Walked together down a dead end street
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet
Don't try to figure out what we might of had
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad

I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
Rolling the dice, not always a winner
You say I've been lucky, well hell I've made my own
Not part of the crowd, but not feeling alone

Under pressure, but not bent out of shape
Surrounded, we always found an escape
Drove me to drink, but hey that's not all bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Guess I've been greedy, all of my life
Greedy with my children, my lovers, my wife
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked, the swinging's stopped swinging
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
Then after you did it, you came crying for my help

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm not complaining, baby I'm glad
You call it a compromise, well what's that
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad"
Nancy Sinatra,Until It's Time For You To Go,"You're not a dream, you're not an angel
You're a man
I'm not a queen, I'm a woman
Take my hand

We'll make a space in the lives
That we'd planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different, worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played at the start
Like in a game

You could have stayed outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Love me, love me, just love me now

This love of mine, had no beginning
And it has no end
I was an oak but now I'm a willow
Now I can bend

You're not a dream, you're not an angel
You're a man
I'm not a queen, I'm a woman
Just take my hand

We'll make a space in the lives
That we'd planned
And here we'll stay

Until it's time for you to go"

And kiss him and love him
And show him that you care

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him
Girl, you won't get him wishin' and a-hopin'

Nancy Sinatra,Your Groovy Self,"Don't talk to strangers on the bus
You know that could be dangerous
Don't walk on stick or stones
Don't answer ringing phones
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Don't take up with no alley cats
They really don't know where it's at
Don't fall or trip on things
Stay away from happenings
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Be careful walking down the street
You never know what you might meet
Don't change a thing or two
I'm hung up child on you
You know I got to worry
Til you bring your groovy self on home to me

Get your groovy self on home"

Bob Marley,War,"Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another inferior
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war, me say war.

That until there are no longer first class
And second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
me say war.

That until the basic human rights are equally
Guaranteed to all, without regard to race
Dis a war.

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace, world citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion
To be pursued, but never attained
Now everywhere is war, war.

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
That hold our brothers in angola, in mozambique,
South africa sub-human bondage
Have been toppled, utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war, me say war.

War in the east, war in the west
War up north, war down south
War, war, rumours of war.

And until that day, the african continent
Will not know peace, we africans will fight
We find it necessary and we know we shall win
As we are confident in the victory.

Of good over evil, good over evil, good over evil
Good over evil, good over evil, good over evil."

Triumphantly.

A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge, I say
Of which I'll share with you, yeah
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Bob Marley,Natural Mystic,"There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
One and all got to face reality now

Though I try to find the answer
To all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible
To go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
Such a natural mystic
Blowing through the air

This could be the first trumpet
Might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
There's a natural mystic
Blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie

Bob Marley,Buffalo Soldier,"Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Dreadie, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo, woe yoe yoe

Buffalo Soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland
To the heart of the caribbean

Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo woe yo yoe

Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier

Catch a fire so you can get burned
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch a fire you’re gonna get burned

Ev’ry time I hear the crack of the whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship

Only to be chained in poverty

It’s only a machine that make money

Slave driver the table is turned
Slave driver the table is turned baby now
Catch a fire so you can get burned baby now

Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown
Oh someone help me 'cause
I,(sweet life), I've, I've got to pick myself from off the ground, yeah

The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years;
(400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)
And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see.
Why do they fight against the poor youth of today?
And without these youths, they would be gone -
All gone astray

Come on, let's make a move:
(make a move, make a move. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come,
And if-a fools don't see
(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.

Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)
That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see.
Said, it's four hundred long years - (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy.

It's been 400 years, (400 years, 400 years)

Bob Marley,Brain Washing,"Wooo-ohhhh
Old Mr. Joe he build a house, yeah
On top of some hill
Old Mr. Joe knew he had to go, so
He got right down and wrote a will
He say now here is to mother hen, and her chicken,
lord have mercy now
Master will you take a roll in the mud,
like he know he should

The old barnyard, the old barnyard, birds and the chick,
oooh-ee
Who's got to watch out for brother mangoose,
with his top hap and walking stick
It's just the poor's brainwashing
They told me a long time gone, it's just the poor's brainwashing,
ooh-ee [the old brain washing]
Now look at a thing like this
Cinderella and her long lost fellow, in the midnight hour,
she lost her silver slipper
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, while Jack and Jill
had themselves a fall
It's just the poor [brain washing]
And I don't need it no longer
It's just the poor's brain washing
Coming through to a poor man's child, ooh-ee, look at this
Little Miss Muffet she sat on her tuffet
While Little Red Ridinghood delivered her Grandma's food
Ooh-ee ooh-ee, ooh-ee
Look at one more thing like this
The cow jumping over the moon, while the dish got jealous,
he grabbed the hand of the spoon
It's just the poor brain washing, and I don't need it no longer
I don't want it no longer
I don't need it no longer
And I don't care for no more brain washing
It isn't good for my soul..."

Bob Marley,Hallelujah Time,"Hear the children cryin',
but I know they cry not in vain.
Now the times are changin';
love has come to bloom again.

Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
reminds us of youthful days.
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops,
but the sweat from man's brow;
the substance from our spine.
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time:
Hallelujah time!

Yes, you can hear the children singing: Hallelujah time!
As they go singing by and by: Hallelujah time!
Oh, ""hallelujah"" singing in the morning.
Hallelujah time! Let them sing; don't let them cry.

Over rocks and mountains
the sheep are scattered all around.
Over hills and valleys,
they are everywhere to be found.
But though we bear our burdens now,
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough.

Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree.

Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing.
Hallelujah time! Yes, as they go singing by and by.
Hallelujah time! Oh ""hallelujah"" singing in the morning.
Let them sing; never let them cry.
Hallelujah time! ""Hallelujah"" singin' in the morning.

Judge not
Before you judge yourself.
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement. Woah oh oh!

The road of life is rocking
And you may stumble too.
So while you talk about me
Someone else is judging you,
Someone else is judging you,
Someone else is judging you,
Someone else is judging you,
Someone else is judging you.

Bob Marley,No Sympathy,"I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

When I'm in my trouble here
Only me feels the pain
Not one good word of advice
From any of my so called friends

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

Might as well, might as well
I get out, I get out of hell
Hell would never be made for me
So I'm gonna search, search 'till I'm free

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness

Bob Marley,One Cup Of Coffee,"One cup of coffee, then I'll go;
Though I just dropped by to let you know
That I'm leaving you tomorrow;
I'll cause you no more sorrow:
One cup of coffee, then I'll go.

I brought the money like the lawyer said to do,
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you;
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know,
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go.

Saxophone solo

Tell the kids I came last night
And kissed them while they slept;
Make my coffee sweet and warm
Just the way you used to lie in my arms.

I brought the money like the lawyer said to do,
But it won't replace the 'eartache I caused you;
It won't take the place of lovin' you, I know,
So one cup of coffee, then I'll go;
One cup of coffee, then I'll go;
One cup of coffee, then I'll go."

Bob Marley,Pass it on,"What your hands do,
It's your own eyes that've seen.
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean?

It's your own conscience
That is gonna remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is gonna judge.

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on. (Pass it on, children)
Help your brothers (help them) in their needs:
Pass it on.

Live for yourself and you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.

In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on.

What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light.
We're not here to judge what's good from bad
But to do the things that are right.

On a hot, sunny day,
Follow the shadows for rescue.
But as the day grows old,
I know the sun is gonna find you.

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on.
Help your brothers in their needs:
Pass it on.

Live for yourself, you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.

In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on. (Pass it on)"

Destruction of the soul is vanity, yeah!

So stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity, yea-ea-eah!
Yes, you have gone - gone for so long
With your love for vanity now.

But I don't wanna rule ya!
I don't wanna fool ya!
I don't wanna school ya:
Things you - you might never know about!

Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain - vain imagination:
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for, o-ooh, simplicity. /fadeout/

Bob Marley,Stop that train,"Stop that train: I'm leavin' - today!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

All my good life I've been a lonely man,
Teachin' my people who don't understand;
And even though I tried my best,
I still can't find no happiness.

So I got to say:
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - oh, baby now!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

Some goin' east; and-a some goin' west,
Some stand aside to try their best.
Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small::
They just can't even find no food at all.

I mean, stop it:
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin', mm-hmm.
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.

Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin'!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - can't take it!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong. /fadeout/

Bob Marley,Survival,"How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care
When everytime I look around
The people suffer in suffering
In everyway. In everywhere

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival

I tell you what
Some people got everything
Some people got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
Yes we're the survivors like
Daniel out of the lions' den, survivors, survivors

So my brethren, my sisthren
Which way will we choose
We better hurry, oh hurry woe now
'Cause we got no time to lose

Some people got facts and claims
Some peole got pride and shame
Some people got the plots and schemes
Some people got no aim it seems

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
We're the survivors; yes, the black survival
We're the survivors like shadrach, meshach and abednego
Thrown in the fire but never get burn

So my brethren, my sisthren
The preaching and talking is done
We gotta live up woe now, woe now
'Cause the father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long

Na-na-na-na-na
We're the survivors; a black survival
In this age of technological inhumanity
We're the survivors black survival
Scientific atrocity, we're the survivors
Atomic mis-philosophy, we're the survivors
Nuclear mis-energy
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity
All together now we're the survivors
Yes, the black survival
A good man is never honoured in his own country, black survival
Nothing change, nothing strange
Nothing change, nothing strange
We got to survive, we've got to survive
But to live as one equal in the eyes of the almighty"

Bob Marley,Who Feels It (Knows It),"Every man thinks his burden is the heaviest
But (ooh, yea, come on) they know because they feel
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

Don't sit by your window gazing at the streets
Just get up and move, get right on your feet
Just get up and move (brothers)
Get right in the groove (sisters)
Just get up and move (brothers)
Get right in the groove (sisters)

For linger you linger, die you must die
So don't point your fingers and you'll get by
No, no, no, don't lie, don't lie, don't cry

(...)

Every man thinks his burden is the heaviest
But (ooh, yea, come on) they know because they feel
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

I said I feel it, and I know it
I said I feel it, and I know it
Said I feel it, and I know it
I said I feel it, yes, and you know it
If you feel it, then you know it
If you feel it, then you know it"
Bob Marley,Who The Cap Fit,"Man to man is so unjust, children
You don't know who to trust
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
And your best friend your worst enemy

Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
Only your friend know your secrets
So only he could reveal it
And who the cap fit, let them wear it (repeat)
Said I throw me corn, me no call no fowl
I saying, ""cok-cok-cok, cluck-cluck-cluck""

Some will hate you, pretend they love you now
Then behind they try to eliminate you
But who Jah bless, no one curse
Thank God we're past the worse

Hypocrites and parasites
Will come up and take a bite
And if your night should turn to day
A lot of people would run away
And who the cap fit let them wear it (repeat)

And then a gonna trhow me corn
And then a gonna call no fowl
And then a gonna ""Cok-cok-cok, cluck-cluck-cluck""

Some will eat and drink with you
And then behind them su-su 'pon you
And if your night should turn to day
A lot of people will run away
And who the cap fit, let them wear it (repeat)

I saying ""Cok-cok-cok, cluck-cluck-cluck"""
Bob Marley,Why Should I,"Why should I bend down my head and cry?

To pick our choice.

The sheep has heard their master's voice.
So tell me why.

Why should I bend down my head and cry?
No reason why.

All the riches in the earth.
So tell me why,
Why should I bend down my head and cry?"
