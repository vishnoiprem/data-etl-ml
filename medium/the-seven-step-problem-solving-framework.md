I used to think I was a good problem solver.

Then I watched a McKinsey consultant dismantle a problem I'd been wrestling with for months — in about 45 minutes. What took me weeks of spreadsheets, late nights, and circular thinking, she reduced to a single page with boxes and arrows.

"That's it?" I asked, staring at her whiteboard sketch.

"That's it," she smiled. "The answer was always there. You just needed a better way to see it."

That conversation sent me down a rabbit hole. I read *Bulletproof Problem Solving* by Charles Conn. I talked to former consultants. I practiced the method on everything — from "should I change jobs?" to "why is our product retention falling?"

What I discovered wasn't magic. It was a **system**. And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

Here's the seven-step framework that elite problem solvers use — explained in plain English, with examples you can actually use.

## Why Most People Suck at Solving Problems

Before we dive in, let's be honest about why problem solving is hard.

Most of us do one of three things when facing a complex challenge:

1. **We panic and act too fast.** Something's wrong, so we start "fixing" things before we understand what's actually broken.

2. **We overthink and never act.** We gather data endlessly, run more analyses, have more meetings — but never reach a decision.

3. **We solve the wrong problem.** We work incredibly hard on something that, even if solved perfectly, wouldn't actually help.

Sound familiar? Yeah, me too.

The seven-step framework prevents all three traps. It forces you to slow down at the beginning (when it matters most) and speed up at the end (when most people stall).

Let's walk through it.

## Step 1: Define the Problem (The Step Everyone Skips)

> "It is surprising how often people jump past this step and make a bunch of assumptions."
> — Hugo Sarrazin, McKinsey Senior Partner

This is the step that separates amateurs from professionals.

Most people rush past problem definition because they think they already know what the problem is. But here's what usually happens:

You gather your team. Someone says, "We need to grow in Japan." Everyone nods. You spend the next three months building strategies, financial models, and go-to-market plans for "growing in Japan."

Then, at the final presentation, the CEO frowns and says: "But I specifically wanted to know if we should grow our *software* product in Japan, not our hardware."

Three months. Wasted.

### How to Define Problems Like a Pro

A good problem statement is **specific**, **actionable**, and **bounded**.

**Bad problem statement:**
> "How can we grow in Japan?"

**Good problem statement:**
> "What is the optimal entry strategy for our SaaS product in the Japanese enterprise market, given a $5M budget and 18-month timeline, assuming we cannot acquire local companies?"

See the difference? The good statement tells you:
- What you're growing (SaaS product, not hardware)
- Who you're targeting (enterprise market)
- What resources you have ($5M, 18 months)
- What's off the table (acquisitions)

### The Questions That Sharpen Your Problem Definition

Before you start solving, ask:
- **What decision does this need to inform?** (Are we deciding whether to enter Japan, or how?)
- **What's the timeline?** (Do we need an answer in a week or six months?)
- **What precision is required?** (Is "roughly 20-30%" good enough, or do we need exact numbers?)
- **What's off limits?** (Are there options we can't consider?)
- **Who's the decision maker?** (Whose opinion actually matters?)

I once spent a week building a beautiful analysis for a CEO, only to discover the real decision maker was the CFO — who wanted completely different information. Don't make my mistake.

### Real Example: The Solar Panel Decision

Let's say you're considering putting solar panels on your house. Most people frame it as: "Should I get solar panels?"

That's too vague. A better problem definition:

> "Given my current electricity costs, roof orientation, local incentives, and 10-year time horizon, what is the net present value of installing solar panels versus staying on grid power, and what would have to change to flip the decision?"

Now you know exactly what to analyze.

---

## Step 2: Break It Down with Logic Trees

Here's where the magic starts.

Every complex problem is made of smaller, simpler problems. A **logic tree** helps you see those pieces — and figure out which ones actually matter.

### The Classic Profit Tree

Let's say profits are falling at your company. Where do you even start?

You draw a tree:

```
PROFIT
├── REVENUE
│   ├── Price
│   │   ├── List price
│   │   └── Discounts/promotions
│   └── Volume
│       ├── Number of customers
│       └── Purchases per customer
└── COSTS
    ├── Variable costs
    │   ├── Materials
    │   ├── Labor
    │   └── Shipping
    └── Fixed costs
        ├── Rent
        ├── Salaries
        └── Technology
```

Now, instead of vaguely worrying about "profits," you can ask specific questions:
- Is the problem on the revenue side or cost side?
- If revenue, is it price or volume?
- If volume, are we losing customers or are existing customers buying less?

Each branch becomes a hypothesis you can test.

### Why Multiple Trees Are Better

Charles Conn suggests doing **two or three different cuts** at the same problem. Each gives you a different insight.

For the profit problem, you might also try:
- **By customer segment:** Where are profits falling? Enterprise? SMB? Consumer?
- **By geography:** Is this happening everywhere or just certain regions?
- **By product:** Which products are struggling?

Different trees reveal different truths.

### Real Example: Saving Pacific Salmon

When Charles worked with the Gordon Moore Foundation on saving Pacific salmon (yes, really), they used the same approach:

```
SALMON SURVIVAL
├── Ocean conditions (big impact, can't control)
├── River conditions
│   ├── Water temperature
│   └── Pollution levels
├── Habitat
│   ├── Spawning grounds
│   └── Migration routes
└── Harvesting practices
    ├── Commercial fishing
    └── Sport fishing
```

By mapping it out, they realized ocean conditions were huge — but unchangeable. So they focused on habitat and harvesting, where they could actually make a difference.

This became a 15-year conservation effort that produced real results.

---

## Step 3: Prioritize Ruthlessly

Your logic tree will have lots of branches. You can't investigate them all — not well, anyway.

The third step is asking two questions about each branch:

1. **How big is this lever?** If this branch is the problem, how much would fixing it matter?
2. **Can we actually move it?** Do we have the ability, resources, and authority to change this?

You want to focus on branches that are **big AND movable**.

### The Prioritization Matrix

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        │   INVESTIGATE  │   FOCUS HERE   │
        │   (maybe)      │   (definitely) │
LOW     │                │                │  HIGH
ABILITY ├────────────────┼────────────────┤  ABILITY
TO MOVE │   IGNORE       │   QUICK WINS   │  TO MOVE
        │                │   (do fast)    │
        └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

In the salmon example:
- **Ocean conditions:** High impact, low ability to move → Acknowledge, but don't focus
- **Harvesting practices:** High impact, high ability to move → Focus here
- **Sport fishing regulations:** Low impact, high ability to move → Quick win, but don't over-invest

### The Public Policy Trap

This is where many policy debates go wrong. People argue endlessly about branches that are either:
- Not important (small impact on the actual outcome)
- Not movable (no one has the power or resources to change them)

Good problem solvers cut through this noise fast.

## Step 4: Build a Work Plan (But Keep It Flexible)

Now you know what to focus on. Time to figure out how to investigate it.

A work plan answers:
- Who's doing what?
- What analyses need to happen?
- What data do we need?
- What's the timeline?
- What level of precision do we need?

### The One-Day Answer

Here's something counterintuitive: **solve the problem on day one.**

Not perfectly. Not with full backing. But get to an answer fast — even if it's rough.

Why? Because:
1. It forces you to think through the whole problem
2. It reveals what you don't know
3. It gives you something to react to (easier than starting from blank)
4. It might be good enough (sometimes the stakes don't require perfection)

As Hugo Sarrazin puts it: *"I can solve any problem during a good dinner with wine. It won't have a whole lot of backing. But it may be useful as a starting point."*

### Level 1, 2, and 3 Answers

Not every problem needs the same rigor.

- **Level 1:** Rough answer based on logic and quick estimates (hours)
- **Level 2:** Supported by data and analysis (days to weeks)
- **Level 3:** Fully validated with multiple methodologies (weeks to months)

Match your effort to the stakes. A $100M investment decision needs Level 3. Choosing which vendor to use for lunch catering? Level 1 is fine.

### Iteration Is Everything

> "Every time you see a 50-page work plan that stretches out to three months, you know it's wrong."
> — Charles Conn

The best work plans are living documents. You learn things. You adjust. The branches you thought mattered might not. New questions emerge.

Build in checkpoints to reassess and pivot.

## Step 5: Conduct the Analysis

You've defined the problem, broken it down, prioritized, and planned the work. Now you actually do the analysis.

### Start Simple

I know it's tempting to fire up the machine learning models. Resist.

Start with:
- **Simple heuristics:** Rules of thumb that give you directional answers
- **Descriptive statistics:** Averages, ranges, distributions — the basics
- **Visual exploration:** Charts that help you see patterns

Only go to complex methods when simple ones aren't enough.

### The A/B Testing Mindset

Sometimes the best analysis is just... trying things.

Hugo Sarrazin describes a "test and learn" methodology that's increasingly common:
1. Form a hypothesis
2. Design a quick test
3. Measure results
4. Learn and iterate

This works especially well for product decisions, marketing experiments, and operational improvements.

### Beware of Biases

Every human brain has bugs. Some to watch for:

**Availability bias:** You've seen this problem before, so you assume this case is the same. (It might not be.)

**Confirmation bias:** You look for data that supports what you already believe. (Look for disconfirming evidence too.)

**Anchoring:** The first number you hear sticks in your mind and skews everything else. (Start with fresh analysis.)

**Sunflower bias:** Junior people defer to senior people's opinions. (Have junior team members share their views first.)

### Diversity Helps

Different backgrounds see different things. A team with varied experience, expertise, and perspectives will catch blind spots that homogeneous teams miss.

This isn't just nice-to-have. It's a competitive advantage in problem solving.

## Step 6: Synthesize (Don't Just Summarize)

Here's where many people fail — especially smart, analytical people.

They do great analysis. They have findings. But they can't answer the question: **"So what?"**

**Summarizing** is listing what you found.

**Synthesizing** is weaving those findings into an answer that helps someone make a decision.

### The Pyramid Principle

Structure your synthesis as:
1. **The answer** (lead with your recommendation)
2. **The key reasons** (3-5 supporting points)
3. **The evidence** (data behind each point)

Don't make people wade through your analysis to find the answer. Give them the answer first, then back it up.

### Real Example

**Bad (summary):**
> "We analyzed customer segments, pricing data, competitor positioning, and market trends. Here are 47 slides of findings..."

**Good (synthesis):**
> "We should enter the Japanese market through a partnership with a local distributor, not direct sales. Three reasons: 
> 1) Enterprise sales cycles in Japan require local relationships we don't have
> 2) Partnership reduces our upfront investment by 60%
> 3) Competitor analysis shows this is how every successful entrant has done it
> 
> Here's the supporting evidence..."

See how the second version helps the decision maker actually decide?

## Step 7: Communicate to Drive Action

The final step is often overlooked: getting people to actually do something.

Analysis without action is just expensive trivia.

### Tell a Story

Humans respond to stories, not spreadsheets. Your synthesis should have:
- **A beginning:** What's the problem and why does it matter?
- **A middle:** What did you discover and what does it mean?
- **An end:** What should we do about it?

### Know Your Audience

Different stakeholders need different things:
- **The CEO** wants the recommendation and why
- **The CFO** wants the numbers and risks
- **The team** wants to know what they should do Monday morning

Tailor your communication to each.

### Be Honest About Uncertainty

> "Often, people lack humility in the way they make their recommendations. They're very precise, and I think we would all be well-served to say, 'This is a likely answer under the following sets of conditions.'"
> — Hugo Sarrazin

Don't pretend you have certainty you don't have. Smart decision makers appreciate knowing:
- What you're confident about
- What you're less sure about
- What would change your recommendation

This builds trust and leads to better decisions.

## Bonus: How This Relates to Design Thinking

If you've heard of design thinking, you might wonder how it fits.

The short answer: they're complementary.

**Design thinking** emphasizes:
- Deep empathy for users (understanding problems through observation)
- Divergent thinking (generating many possible solutions)
- Rapid prototyping (building things quickly to learn)
- Iteration (improving through cycles)

**Structured problem solving** emphasizes:
- Clear problem definition (understanding problems through analysis)
- Logical disaggregation (breaking problems into parts)
- Rigorous prioritization (focusing on what matters)
- Synthesis (turning analysis into answers)

The best teams use both. Use design thinking when you need to understand users and generate creative solutions. Use structured problem solving when you need to make rigorous decisions and build conviction.

## A Framework You Can Use Tomorrow

Here's the cheat sheet version:

| Step | Question | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1. Define | What exactly are we trying to solve? | Clear problem statement |
| 2. Disaggregate | What are the component parts? | Logic tree |
| 3. Prioritize | Which parts matter most and can we affect? | Focus areas |
| 4. Plan | How will we investigate? | Work plan |
| 5. Analyze | What does the data tell us? | Findings |
| 6. Synthesize | What does it all mean? | "So what" insights |
| 7. Communicate | How do we drive action? | Recommendations |

Try it this week. Pick a problem you've been stuck on — personal or professional — and work through these steps.

I promise it will feel different. Clearer. More actionable.

Because here's the truth: the problem solving methodology itself is just a tool. What really changes is **you**. You start seeing problems differently. You ask better questions. You cut through noise faster.

And that skill — like compound interest — keeps paying off for the rest of your life.
