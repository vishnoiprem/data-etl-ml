"Hi, my name is Prem Vishnoi. I’m a data science leader with over 15 years of experience in the banking and financial sector, as well as retail banking. Recently, I’ve been working with CP Extra, helping to expand their data and AI capabilities. For instance, I led projects like a demand forecasting model and the implementation of ChatGPT for search and recommendation systems. Previously, I also reduced annual costs by $2.4 million and grew my team from 5 to 25 members.

I’m particularly excited about the opportunity at Standard Chartered because of the scale of AI opportunities in corporate and investment banking, the bank’s commitment to responsible AI, and the cross-border focus that aligns with my expertise in NLP and fraud detection.

**Q2: "Describe a challenging data science project you led."**
> Use STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
> - Keep to 90 seconds
> - Include specific metrics
> - Show leadership and technical depth

One of the most challenging data science projects I led involved tackling significant fraud losses. Our legacy system was causing about $10 million in annual losses due to fraud, and it had a high false positive rate of around 40%, which negatively impacted customer experience.

To address this, I led the development and deployment of a new real-time machine learning system. First, I assembled a cross-functional team that included risk, engineering, and product experts. We transitioned to a cloud-first architecture to ensure scalability and performance.

Technically, we implemented a two-stage model: first, a lightweight gradient boosting model for initial scoring, and then a deep learning network to analyze transaction sequences over time. We also set up a continuous feedback loop to retrain the model regularly.

As a result, we reduced annual fraud losses by 65%, saving around $6 million, and we cut the false positive rate from 40% down to 12%, which significantly improved the customer experience. The system was also scalable and handled peak volumes, ensuring that our fraud prevention could keep pace with growth.

Overall, this project not only saved the company millions but also enhanced customer trust and experience.

**Q3: "How do you stay current with AI developments?"**
> "I stay current through multiple channels:
> - Reading papers on arXiv and attending NeurIPS/ICML virtually
> - Hands-on experimentation with new models (recently fine-tuned Llama for document classification)
> - Active in the HuggingFace community
> - Internal knowledge sharing — I run monthly AI updates for my team
> - Practical application — I don't just read about techniques, I implement them"



To stay current with AI developments, I use multiple channels. I regularly read and write articles on platforms like Medium, and I often experiment with AI models using Google Colab. I also enroll in online university courses and attend industry meetups and seminars to keep up with the latest trends.

In addition, I actively engage with the research community by reading papers from top conferences like NeurIPS and ICML. I also run monthly AI update sessions within my team to share knowledge. Most importantly, I believe in hands-on practice, so I don’t just read about techniques, I implement them. For example, I recently fine-tuned a LLaMA model for document classification. This blend of continuous learning and practical application helps me stay at the forefront of AI advancements

## 💻 ROUND 2: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (60 min)

### A. Python & OOP (10 min)

**Q1: "Explain object-oriented programming principles and how you apply them in data science."**

> "The four pillars are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
>
> **In data science, I apply these through:**
>
> **Encapsulation:** I create classes that bundle data and methods together. For example, a `FeatureEngineer` class that encapsulates all feature transformation logic with methods like `fit()`, `transform()`, and `get_feature_names()`.
>
> **Abstraction:** I define abstract base classes for model interfaces. All models implement `train()`, `predict()`, `evaluate()` methods, hiding implementation details.
>
> **Inheritance:** I create a base `BaseModel` class and inherit from it for specific models. This ensures consistent interfaces and reduces code duplication.
>
> **Polymorphism:** Different model classes can be used interchangeably because they share the same interface. This makes A/B testing and model comparison seamless.
>
> **Example:** In my last project, I built a modular ML pipeline where each component (data loader, feature engineer, model trainer, evaluator) was a separate class. This made the code testable, maintainable, and easy to extend."

### B. Machine Learning (15 min)

**Q3: "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff. How do you handle it in practice?"**

> "**Bias** is the error from overly simplistic assumptions — the model underfits. **Variance** is the error from sensitivity to training data fluctuations — the model overfits.
>
> **In practice, I handle this through:**
>
> 1. **Cross-validation:** I use k-fold CV to estimate both bias (average error) and variance (error spread across folds)
>
> 2. **Learning curves:** Plotting training vs validation error as data increases. High bias = both errors high and flat. High variance = gap between training and validation.
>
> 3. **Regularization:** L1/L2 for linear models, dropout for neural networks, early stopping
>
> 4. **Ensemble methods:** Bagging reduces variance (Random Forest), Boosting reduces bias (XGBoost)
>
> 5. **Model complexity tuning:** Start simple, increase complexity only if bias is the problem
>
> **Example:** In a fraud detection project, my initial logistic regression had high bias (70% recall). I moved to XGBoost which improved recall to 85%, then used regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting."

---

**Q4: "You're building a model to detect fraudulent transactions. Walk me through your approach."**

> "**1. Problem Understanding:**
> - Define fraud precisely — what types? (unauthorized, identity theft, account takeover)
> - Understand business constraints — what's the cost of false positives vs false negatives?
> - Typical class imbalance: 0.1-1% fraud rate
>
> **2. Data Preparation:**
> - Transaction features: amount, time, merchant category, location
> - Velocity features: transactions in last hour/day, unusual patterns
> - Behavioral features: deviation from customer's normal behavior
> - Network features: relationships between accounts
>
> **3. Handling Imbalance:**
> - NOT just accuracy — focus on precision-recall tradeoff
> - Techniques: SMOTE for oversampling, class weights, anomaly detection approach
> - Evaluate with PR-AUC, F1 at various thresholds
>
> **4. Model Selection:**
> - Start with interpretable: Logistic Regression with engineered features
> - Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) for better performance
> - Potentially deep learning (autoencoders for anomaly detection)
>
> **5. Evaluation:**
> - Time-based split (not random) — train on past, test on future
> - Monitor precision@k for operational use
> - A/B test with fraud investigation team
>
> **6. Production Considerations:**
> - Real-time scoring requirement
> - Model explainability for investigators
> - Feedback loop for confirmed fraud cases
> - Drift monitoring"

---

**Q5: "How do you handle missing data in a production ML system?"**

> "My approach depends on the missingness mechanism:
>
> **1. Understand WHY data is missing:**
> - MCAR (Missing Completely at Random): Can use simple imputation
> - MAR (Missing at Random): Need more sophisticated methods
> - MNAR (Missing Not at Random): Missingness itself is informative
>
> **2. Production-ready strategies:**
>
> **For numerical features:**
> - Median imputation (robust to outliers)
> - Add a 'is_missing' binary indicator feature
> - For time series: forward fill or interpolation
>
> **For categorical features:**
> - Treat missing as a separate category
> - Mode imputation if rare
>
> **Advanced methods:**
> - KNN imputation for correlated features
> - Iterative imputation (MICE) for complex patterns
>
> **3. Production considerations:**
> - Imputation parameters (median, mode) must be saved from training
> - Handle new missing patterns not seen in training
> - Monitor missing rates — sudden changes indicate data quality issues
>
> **Example:** In a credit risk model, I found that missing income data was informative — customers who didn't report income had 3x higher default rates. I created an 'income_missing' feature and it became a top predictor."

### C. NLP & Deep Learning (15 min)

**Q6: "Explain the Transformer architecture. How would you use it for document classification?"**

> "**Transformer Architecture:**
>
> The core innovation is **self-attention** — allowing each token to attend to all other tokens, capturing long-range dependencies without recurrence.
>
> **Key components:**
> - **Embeddings:** Token + positional embeddings
> - **Multi-Head Attention:** Multiple attention heads capture different relationships
> - **Feed-Forward Networks:** Process attention output
> - **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections:** Enable deep networks
>
> **For Document Classification:**
>
> **Approach 1: Fine-tune Pre-trained Model**
> ```python
> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
> 
> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
>     'bert-base-uncased', 
>     num_labels=num_classes
> )
> # Add classification head on top of [CLS] token
> # Fine-tune on domain data
> ```
>
> **Approach 2: For Long Documents (trade finance docs)**
> - Use Longformer or BigBird (handle >512 tokens)
> - Or chunk documents and aggregate predictions
>
> **Approach 3: Domain Adaptation**
> - First, continue pre-training on banking documents (MLM objective)
> - Then fine-tune for classification
>
> **Production considerations:**
> - Distillation for faster inference (DistilBERT)
> - Quantization for deployment
> - Batch processing for throughput"

**Q8: "Explain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). How would you implement it?"**

> "**RAG combines retrieval with generation:**
> Instead of relying solely on LLM's parametric knowledge, we retrieve relevant documents and include them in the prompt.
>
> **Architecture:**
> ```
> Query → Retriever → Top-K Documents → LLM (Query + Context) → Answer
> ```
>
> **Implementation with LangChain:**
>
> ```python
> from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
> from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
> from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
> from langchain.llms import OpenAI
>
> # 1. Create embeddings
> embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
>
> # 2. Build vector store
> documents = load_documents()  # Your knowledge base
> vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
>
> # 3. Create retrieval chain
> qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
>     llm=OpenAI(),
>     chain_type="stuff",
>     retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
> )
>
> # 4. Query
> response = qa_chain.run("What are the KYC requirements for corporate clients?")
> ```
>
> **Banking Use Cases:**
> - Policy Q&A for compliance teams
> - Product knowledge for relationship managers
> - Regulatory requirement lookup
>
> **Key Considerations:**
> - **Chunking strategy:** Overlap chunks, respect document boundaries
> - **Embedding model:** Domain-specific fine-tuning improves retrieval
> - **Reranking:** Use cross-encoder to rerank retrieved docs
> - **Hallucination prevention:** Include source citations, confidence scores
> - **Security:** Ensure retrieval respects access controls"

### B. Stakeholder Management (15 min)

**Q4: "How do you communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders?"**

> "My communication framework:
>
> **1. Know Your Audience:**
> - C-level: Business outcomes, ROI, risks
> - Product owners: Capabilities, timelines, trade-offs
> - Operations: How to use it, what to expect
>
> **2. Lead with the 'So What':**
> - Start with business impact, not technical approach
> - 'This model will reduce false positives by 40%' not 'We used XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning'
>
> **3. Use Analogies:**
> - 'The model learns patterns like a fraud investigator would, but can check 1 million transactions per second'
>
> **4. Visualize:**
> - Charts over numbers
> - Before/after comparisons
> - Confusion matrix as business outcomes
>
> **5. Acknowledge Limitations:**
> - Be upfront about what the model can't do
> - Explain confidence levels in business terms
>
> **Example:** Presenting a fraud model to the CFO, I showed:
> - Slide 1: '₹50M annual savings from reduced fraud'
> - Slide 2: 'Current vs proposed process comparison'
> - Slide 3: 'Trade-off between catching more fraud vs customer friction'
>
> No mention of algorithms until they asked."

---

**Q5: "Describe a situation where you had to push back on a stakeholder request."**

> "**Situation:** A business leader wanted a model deployed in 2 weeks that required at least 6 weeks to do properly.
>
> **Challenge:** Saying 'no' to a senior stakeholder while maintaining relationship.
>
> **My Approach:**
>
> 1. **Listened first:** Understood the underlying business need (quarterly board presentation)
>
> 2. **Quantified the risk:** 'Rushing deployment increases error risk. A 5% accuracy drop means ₹10M in false positives.'
>
> 3. **Offered alternatives:**
>    - Option A: MVP in 2 weeks with 70% accuracy, full model in 6 weeks
>    - Option B: Use rule-based approach now, ML model next quarter
>    - Option C: 4-week accelerated timeline with additional resources
>
> 4. **Documented agreement:** Email summary of chosen approach and trade-offs
>
> **Result:** They chose Option A. MVP performed well enough for the board presentation, and we delivered the full model on schedule.
>
> **Key Learning:** Always offer alternatives. 'No' without options damages relationships."

---

### D. Behavioral (15 min)

**Q8: "Tell me about a time you failed. What did you learn?"**

> "**Situation:** At [Company], I led a project to build a customer churn prediction model. We spent 3 months building a sophisticated deep learning model.
>
> **What Went Wrong:**
> - Model achieved 92% AUC in testing
> - But in production, churn predictions weren't actionable
> - The business team couldn't intervene in time — predictions were too late
>
> **Root Cause:**
> - I focused on model accuracy, not business process
> - Didn't involve operations team early enough
> - Optimized for the wrong metric
>
> **What I Learned:**
>
> 1. **Involve end-users from day one.** Now I start every project with 'how will you use this?'
>
> 2. **Optimize for actionability, not just accuracy.** A 70% model that's actionable beats 92% that isn't.
>
> 3. **Prototype the workflow, not just the model.** Build the intervention process before perfecting the prediction.
>
> **How I've Applied This:**
> In my next project, I spent 2 weeks shadowing the operations team before writing any code. The resulting model was simpler but drove 3x more business impact."

---

**Q9: "Describe your approach when you disagree with your manager's technical decision."**

> "**My approach:**
>
> 1. **Assume good intent.** They have context I might not have.
>
> 2. **Ask questions first.** 'Help me understand the reasoning behind X?'
>
> 3. **Present data, not opinions.** 'Based on our benchmarks, approach A has 20% better performance'
>
> 4. **Propose, don't oppose.** 'What if we tried A for the MVP and compared?'
>
> 5. **Disagree and commit.** If decision stands, execute fully.
>
> **Example:** My manager wanted to use a vendor solution for NLP. I believed in-house was better.
>
> - I asked why: learned about timeline pressures I wasn't aware of
> - I proposed: pilot both for 2 weeks with clear metrics
> - We found: vendor was faster to deploy but our model was 15% better
> - Decision: vendor for MVP, transition to in-house later
>
> **Key:** The goal is the best outcome for the business, not being right."

---

**Q2: "How would you approach understanding our business needs? You're not from banking."**

> "**My Approach to Learning the Domain:**
>
> **Week 1-2: Immersion**
> - Shadow relationship managers and operations teams
> - Sit in on client calls (with permission)
> - Review existing documentation and processes
>
> **Week 3-4: Deep Dives**
> - Interview 5-10 stakeholders across functions
> - Map the end-to-end processes (trade finance, KYC, etc.)

>
> **Ongoing: Structured Learning**
> - Internal training on CIB products
> - Industry reports and competitor analysis
> - Regular business review attendance
>
> **My Track Record:**
> At [Company], I joined without [industry] experience. Within 3 months, I was leading projects that required deep domain knowledge because I:
> - Asked lots of questions (no such thing as a dumb question)
> - Built relationships with domain experts
> - Translated technical solutions into business language
>
> **What I Bring:**
> - Fresh perspective — sometimes outsiders see inefficiencies insiders accept
> - Analytical rigor — I'll question assumptions
> - Technical depth — I can build solutions, not just advise"

---

**Q3: "We have a problem with false positives in our transaction monitoring. How would you approach it?"**

> "**Understanding the Problem:**
>
> Transaction monitoring for AML typically has 95%+ false positive rates — most alerts are not actual suspicious activity. This wastes investigator time and delays genuine cases.
>
> **My Approach:**
>
> **Phase 1: Diagnosis (Week 1-2)**
> - Analyze current alert distribution: which rules generate most false positives?
> - Review a sample of true positives vs false positives: what distinguishes them?
> - Interview investigators: what signals do they use?
>
> **Phase 2: Quick Wins (Week 3-4)**
> - Rule tuning: adjust thresholds on worst-performing rules
> - Prioritization model: rank alerts by likelihood of true positive
> - Investigators focus on high-priority first
>
> **Phase 3: ML Enhancement (Month 2-3)**
> - Build a classification model using historical alert outcomes
> - Features: transaction patterns, customer behavior, network analysis
> - Goal: reduce false positives by 30-50% while maintaining detection rate
>
> **Phase 4: Production & Monitoring (Month 4)**
> - A/B test: ML-assisted vs current process
> - Monitor for drift and new fraud patterns
> - Feedback loop for continuous improvement
>
> **Expected Outcome:**
> - 40% reduction in false positives
> - Investigators handle 2x more alerts
> - Faster escalation of true positives
>
> **Key Consideration:** Model must be explainable for regulators. We'll provide clear reasoning for each alert prioritization."

---

**Q4: "How do you ensure your solutions are actually adopted by the business?"**

> "Adoption is the hardest part. A technically perfect solution that nobody uses is a failure.
>
> **My Adoption Framework:**
>
> **1. Co-Create, Don't Deliver**
> - Involve end-users from problem definition
> - Regular demos and feedback sessions
> - Make them feel ownership
>
> **2. Start with Their Workflow**
> - Integrate into existing tools (not a new system to learn)
> - Minimal behavior change required
> - Quick time to value
>
> **3. Prove Value Early**
> - Pilot with friendly users first
> - Measure and celebrate wins
> - Build case studies
>
> **4. Training & Support**
> - Hands-on training sessions
> - Clear documentation
> - Responsive support channel
>
> **5. Executive Sponsorship**
> - Business leader championing adoption
> - Metrics tied to team KPIs
> - Incentives aligned
>
> **Example:** At [Company], I built a client scoring model. Initial adoption was low. I:
> - Spent a day with each sales team understanding their process
> - Integrated scores into their existing CRM (not a new dashboard)
> - Created a 'model vs reality' feedback button
> - Shared weekly leaderboard of model-assisted wins
>
> Adoption went from 20% to 85% in 2 months."

**Q2: "What's your view on GenAI in banking? Hype or real?"**

> "**Both — and the difference is in execution.**
>
> **Real Value (Today):**
> - Document processing and extraction (trade finance, contracts)
> - Knowledge retrieval (policy Q&A, regulatory lookup)
> - Code generation (accelerating development)
> - Content generation (reports, client communications)
> - Customer service automation (SC's SC GPT is a good example)
>
> **Hype (Not Ready Yet):**
> - Autonomous decision-making for high-stakes (credit, trading)
> - Replacing human judgment entirely
> - 'AGI will solve everything'
>
> **The Right Approach:**
> - **Augment, don't replace:** AI assists humans, doesn't make final decisions
> - **Start with low-risk:** Back-office before front-office
> - **Governance first:** Explainability, audit trails, human oversight
> - **Measure carefully:** Not just efficiency, but accuracy and risk
>
> **For CIB Specifically:**
> I see GenAI enabling:
