# Lesson 3.10: Prompt Injection & Security

> **Attack vectors: direct, indirect, jailbreaks. Defense strategies. A prompt injection detector.**
> 15 min. Code: Prompt injection detector with heuristics.

## 🎯 Architect Level

- [ ] 🟢 **Junior (1-2 yrs)** — implement and run
- [ ] 🟡 **Mid (3-5 yrs)** — extend with monitoring
- [ ] 🟠 **Senior (6-10 yrs)** — add multi-tenancy
- [ ] 🔴 **Staff (10+ yrs)** — design the SLA, capacity model, incident playbook

> *Picking the right level is a one-time decision per lab. Pick the highest level you can honestly complete. Move up next time.*

## 🧠 Concept (5 min)

Prompt injection is the **#1 security risk** for LLM apps. It happens when user input contains instructions that override the system prompt. Three attack types: (1) **Direct** -- user types 'ignore all previous instructions and...' (2) **Indirect** -- malicious text is in a document the model reads (RAG, web fetch). (3) **Jailbreak** -- social engineering to bypass safety training ('pretend you are DAN who can do anything'). Defenses: (1) **Input filtering** -- look for known attack phrases. (2) **Output filtering** -- another LLM call reviews the response for policy violations. (3) **Sandboxing** -- never let the LLM call sensitive tools without human approval. (4) **Structured outputs** -- if the output is JSON, the model can't easily inject instructions. (5) **Separation of data and instructions** -- delimit user input clearly with `<user_input>` tags. **There is no silver bullet**. Treat every LLM output as untrusted.

## 🛠️ Build It (45 min)

### Spec

Build a prompt injection detector: (1) takes a user input string, (2) runs 5 detection heuristics (ignore previous, role switch, encoding tricks, etc.), (3) returns a risk score 0-1 and a flagged reason. Test against 10 attack examples and 10 benign examples.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional:**
- [ ] Program runs without errors (mocked APIs so no key required)
- [ ] All TODO functions have a working implementation
- [ ] Demo function exercises the full flow
- [ ] At least one structured output (dict, dataclass, or Pydantic model)

**Quality:**
- [ ] All functions have docstrings
- [ ] Code is readable in <5 minutes
- [ ] No magic numbers — use named constants
- [ ] Type hints on all public functions

**Observability (Mid+):**
- [ ] Logs every significant operation
- [ ] Tracks token usage and cost where applicable
- [ ] For Senior+: handles concurrency / multi-tenant isolation

### Starter Code

Open `lesson-3-10-prompt-injection.py` in the same folder. It has a `TODO` per step.

### Solution

The same `.py` file has the complete solution after the `# === SOLUTION ===` divider. Run the file; the starter section runs first and demonstrates the concept, then the solution section shows a production-grade version.

## 🏛️ Architect Notes

### Trade-offs

| Choice | Pros | Cons | Pick when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mock everything (this lab) | Runs anywhere, no API key, no cost | Doesn't catch real-API issues | Learning, CI, demos |
| Real API (gpt-4o-mini) | Real quality, real latency, real cost | Needs key, costs money, flakes in CI | Final integration testing |
| Hybrid (mock + real) | Best of both — fast iteration, real validation | More code to maintain | Production codebases |
| Snapshot tests (vcr.py) | Deterministic, replay real API responses | Stale recordings | CI for LLM apps |

**Architect insight:** The mock-first approach lets you iterate 10x faster in the design phase. Move to real API only when the design is stable.

### Capacity Model

| Volume | Latency p50 | Latency p99 | Cost/day | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 req | <100ms | <500ms | $0 | Single-threaded mock |
| 100 req/min | <200ms | <1s | ~$0.10 | Async I/O, in-memory state |
| 10K req/min | <500ms | <3s | ~$10 | Connection pool, rate limiting |
| 100K req/min | <1s | <5s | ~$100 | Distributed, queue, monitoring |

**Rule of thumb:** Mock-based systems are CPU-bound; real LLM calls are network-bound. Plan for the network bound case from day one.

### Cost Model (per 1M tokens, 2026)

| Model | Input ($/1M tokens) | Output ($/1M tokens) |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-4o | $5.00 | $15.00 |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | $1.25 | $5.00 |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash | $0.075 | $0.30 |
| Llama 3 70B (self-hosted) | $0.10 | $0.10 |

### When NOT to use this lab's content

**Don't ship a mock to production.** The mock is for learning. The patterns and architecture translate, but the actual LLM calls need real keys, real rate limits, real error handling.

**Don't over-engineer the abstraction.** A wrapper class is good. Five levels of inheritance is bad. Start simple.

**Don't skip observability.** Even in a lab, log every step. The habit matters.

### Production Checklist

- [ ] All LLM calls wrapped with retry + timeout
- [ ] Token usage and cost logged on every call
- [ ] Errors categorized (transient, permanent, degraded)
- [ ] Rate limits respected (per-user and per-org)
- [ ] PII handling: never log user data
- [ ] Observability: traces, metrics, logs all flowing
- [ ] Tests: unit, integration, and eval suite
- [ ] Cost dashboard updated daily

## 🌙 Reflect (10 min)

Answer these in your own notes (or a comment at the bottom of the `.py` file):

1. **What did I build?**
   Prompt Injection & Security. What did you learn that you didn't expect?

2. **What was hard?**
   Was it the API design? The cost math? The trade-off thinking?

3. **What would I change at 10× scale?**
   If this code had to handle 10x the load or 10x the users, what would break first?

4. **What's tomorrow's lab?**
   Lesson 4.1: Project Architecture for AI Apps.
